Traffic police office came up with the concept to check the high speed of vehicles in Damauli. In-charge of Traffic Police Office Resham Ranabhat shared that the campaign was initiated for lessening road accidents, mostly occurring due to rampant overtake and unnecessary horn honking.\n\n\u201cWe come up with the campaign as high speed of the vehicles increases risk of road accident and unnecessary horn honking causes noise\u201d, he said, adding, \u201cIn the beginning, we will inform and make the drivers aware and bring into legal ambit for breaching the rule later\u201d.\n\nThe Damauli chapter of Tanahun Chamber of Commerce and Industry has supported the traffic campaign.
