He worried that all the eggs in the Centre would go in vain if the Centre could not timely arrange a potent male crocodile for hatching the eggs.\n\n\u201cThe only male crocodile in the Centre could be suffering sperm related issues given his old age,\u201d opined Khadka, adding that there were not any veterinary doctors in Nepal to study and examine crocodile\u2019s sperm.\n\nThe Park has already brought the issue to the notice of the concerned authority last July. Preparations were made to bring a male crocodile of reproductive age from Bardia National Park, informed Haribhadra Acharya of the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation.\n\nAcharya said that they could bring adult male crocodile from India as well but the current situation was not favourable for the same due to ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAltogether five male crocodiles were reported in the Rapti River and the Narayani River but they could not be trapped and used for reproductive purpose as those reptiles were yet to reach their reproductive age, added assistant conservation officer Khadka.\n\nRSS","title":"Crocodile Breeding Centre in Chitwan in need of potent male crocodile - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/14/148776/","video":[]}
