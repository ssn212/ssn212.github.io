Our livelihoods are better than before because, with good roads, we can travel to work at the garment factory and return home easily, so we can meet our children every day,\" the mother of three children said.\n\nThe project has also built a two-story concrete building with 12 classrooms for the Angkomnob Primary School in a Bati district, which has greatly benefited children in Tanorn village.\n\nNavy's 13-year-old daughter Sal Samnang, a sixth-grader of the school, said the project has also provided school supplies to all students of the school.\n\n\"I have received gifts from the Chinese project, including a bicycle, a bag, a water bottle, a lunch box, pens, pencils, and erasers as well as other materials,\" she told Xinhua.\n\n\"I would like to thank China for constructing this school building for us and having brought better development to my village,\" she added.","title":"China-aided poverty alleviation project brings hope to Cambodia's remote village","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/30597/project-brings-hope-","video":[]}
