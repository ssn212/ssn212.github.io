The decision to mark National Journalism Day was made in 2073BS.\n\nThe publication of the Gorkhapatra began on Baisakh 24, 1958BS. On this occasion, journalism educators and observers have stressed the need for Nepali media to change content for media sustainability.\n\nIt is the digital age and Nepali media is facing challenges accordingly.\n\nThe traditional media are bound to compete with new media, as the latter serve news to the public in a quicker and easier way.\n\nThe advent of ICT has a direct impact on the media.\n\nCurrently, there are over 3,786 online media in Nepal, while the number of television in regular operation stands at 87.\n\nSimilarly, 707 FM radios are operative, while the number of registered newspapers is 7,911.\n\nData to this were shared by Department of Information and Broadcasting.\n\nChief of Journalism Department at TU, Professor Chiranjivi Khanal, said Nepali journalism needs to adopt digital technology by adhering to code and related laws.\n\nHe expressed worry that Nepali journalism is now people-focused, while it must be society-focused.\n\nFor the investigation and study, Nepali journalists need to hone skills and expertise, Prof Khanal suggested.\n\nThe evolving citizen journalism has impacted the form of journalism. Why people are doubting over media should be a point to ponder, he added.\n\nSimilarly, Dr Kundan Aryal viewed, \u201cNew media has been obfuscating people. So, media must make themselves more credible.\n\nSimilarly, readers and audiences\u2019 better awareness is required.\u201d It is said there is lack of law to implement the Mass Communications Policy, 2073.\n\nLecturer Rishi Kesh Dahal commented that journalism has been weak in Nepal due to financial constraints, social media impact, political influence, and media itself.\n\n\u201cThe spurt of media at present is unmanageable in terms of financial sustainability. Quality is fast eroding. As media itself is losing accountability, it is losing public trust.\u201d\n\nMoreover, another lecturer Dr Shreeram Paudel worries over quality of media content. Investment on quality media product is imperative, he suggests.\n\n(Sushil Darnal/RSS)","title":"Journalism Day: Time for Nepali media to change content","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/07/303017/","video":[]}
