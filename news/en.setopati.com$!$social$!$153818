They reduce inflammation, which sometimes develops in coronavirus patients as the immune system overreacts to fight the infection. This overreaction damages the lungs and can prove fatal. These drugs are not the same type of steroids that are used or misused for athletic performance.\n\nIn June, a large study led by the University of Oxford found that a steroid called dexamethasone cut deaths by up to 35% in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who needed treatment with breathing machines and by 20% in those only needing extra oxygen. It did not help less sick patients and might even have even been harmful at that stage of illness.\n\nThe results changed care immediately and prompted many other studies that were testing steroids to stop, so more people could be given the drug. The new analysis looked at results from six of those studies that were stopped early plus severe patients in the Oxford study to see if all types of steroids were similarly effective, and concluded they are.\n\nThere were 222 deaths among the 678 patients given a steroid and 425 deaths among the 1,025 patients given placebos or just usual care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted,\u201d said Dr. Derek Angus, critical care chief at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, who helped lead one of the studies. \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly reassuring that the other trials all were lining up in the same direction. It\u2019s the most solid news we\u2019ve had yet on how to take care of patients with COVID-19.\u201d\n\nMark Shannon, a 61-year-old retired bank teller from Pittsburgh who spent 11 days on a breathing machine, received the steroid hydrocortisone in the study and recovered. His doctor told him \u201cthat was pretty stupendous\u201d to recover from so long on a ventilator, he said.\n\n\u201cI realize how close I came to losing my life,\u201d he said.\n\nThe WHO issued treatment advice Wednesday recommending steroids for patients with severe COVID-19 and suggested not using them for less sick patients.\n\nTreatment guidelines in the U.S. now recommend dexamethasone or others only when it\u2019s not available for hospitalized COVID-19 patients needing extra oxygen, but that could change with the new information.","title":"New studies confirm steroids help severely ill COVID-19 patients","url":"http://en.setopati.com/social/153818","video":[]}
