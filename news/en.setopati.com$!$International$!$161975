The suspect remained at large as authorities ordered residents and business owners to stay inside and off the streets.\n\nTwo law enforcement officials told The Associated Press dozens of people also had been wounded. The officials were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\nLewiston Police said in an earlier Facebook post that they were dealing with an active shooter incident at Schemengees Bar and Grille and Sparetime Recreation, a bowling alley about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) away. The Androscoggin County Sheriff\u2019s Office released two photos of the suspect on its Facebook page that showed a shooter walking into an establishment with a weapon raised to their shoulder.\n\n\u201cPlease stay off the roads to allow emergency responders access to the hospitals,\u201d police said.\n\nOn its website, Central Maine Medical Center said staff were \u201creacting to a mass casualty, mass shooter event\u201d and were coordinating with area hospitals to take in patients. A woman who answered the phone in the emergency department said no further information could be released and that the hospital itself was on lockdown.\n\nMelinda Small, the owner of Legends Sports Bar and Grill, said her staff immediately locked their doors and moved all 25 customers and employees away from the doors after a customer reported hearing about the shooting at the bowling alley less than a quarter-mile away around 7 p.m. Soon, the police flooded the roadway and a police officer eventually escorted everyone out of the building four at a time. Everyone in the bar is safe.\n\n\u201cI am honestly in a state of shock. I am blessed that my team responded quickly and everyone is safe,\u201d Small told The Associated Press. \u201cBut the same time, my heart is broken for this area and for what everyone is dealing with. I just feel numb.\u201d\n\nThe alert for Lewiston was made shortly after 8 p.m. as the sheriff\u2019s office reported that law enforcement agencies were investigating \u201ctwo active shooter events.\u201d Officials issued an update around 10 p.m. for what they described as a manhunt.\n\n\u201cAvoid the area until authorities give the all-clear,\u201d the statement said. \u201cSeek alternative routes to circumvent the area and any disruptions. If already operating in the affected region, adhere to all instructions issued by local officials, including the shelter-in-place order.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are encouraging all businesses to lock down and or close while we investigate,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office reported.\n\nA spokesperson for Maine Department of Public Safety urged residents to stay in their homes with their doors locked.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement is currently investigating at two locations right now,\u201d Shannon Moss said. \u201cAgain please stay off the streets and allow law enforcement to diffuse the situation.\u201d\n\nGov. Janet Mills released a statement echoing those instructions. She said she has been briefed on the situation and will remain in close contact with public safety officials.\n\nPresident Joe Biden had spoken by phone to Mills and the state\u2019s Congress members, offering \u201cfull federal support in the wake of this horrific attack,\u201d a White House statement said.\n\nLocal schools will be closed Thursday and people should shelter in place or seek safety, Superintendent Jake Langlais said, adding: \u201cStay close to your loved ones. Embrace them.\u201d\n\nLewiston, about 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Portland, emerged as a major center for African immigration into Maine. The Somali population, which numbers in the thousands, has changed the demographics of the once overwhelmingly white mill city into one of the most diverse in northern New England.\n\nAnge Amores, a spokesperson for the city of Lewiston, said city officials are not commenting on the shooting. Amores said Maine State Police were planning to hold a news conference, likely at city hall, to update the public on Wednesday night.\n\nMaine Sen. Angus King, an independent, said he was \u201cdeeply sad for the city of Lewiston and all those worried about their family, friends and neighbors\u201d and was monitoring the situation. King\u2019s office said the senator would be headed directly home to Maine on the first flight possible.","title":"At least 16 dead and dozens injured in Maine shooting","url":"http://en.setopati.com/International/161975","video":[]}
