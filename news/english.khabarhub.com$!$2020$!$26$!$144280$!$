In June, the Center had banned 59 apps, including Bytedance\u2019s TikTok and Alibaba\u2019s UC Browser, citing security concerns.\n\nThereafter, India banned 47 more Chinese apps that were operating as clones of the 59 apps. In September, 118 more apps ,including popular gaming app PUBG and Baidu, were banned.\n\nThe government has issued the order to block access of users in India to these apps. The decision was based on a comprehensive report from the home ministry\u2019s Indian Cybercrime Coordination Center.\n\nMajor apps of the Alibaba Group, including AliSuppliers Mobile, Alibaba Workbench, AliExpress, and Alipay Cashier, besides driver aggregator Lalamove, and a bunch of dating apps, such as China Social, AsianDate and WeDate, were banned from Tuesday.\n\nThe step may prove to be a shot in the arm for Indian app makers, in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s vision of a self-reliant nation. Indian short video-sharing app Chingari said some of these apps were banned earlier as well, but they just cloaked themselves under new identities to enter the Indian market.\n\n\u201cThe ban is a very smart move and sends out a clear message that Chinese apps can\u2019t use such tactics to engage in activities that are \u2018prejudicial to India\u2019s sovereignty\u2019,\u201d said Sumit Ghosh, chief executive, Chingari.\n\nExperts hailed the move. \u201cThe biggest security concern is that a lot of apps on your smartphones collect massive amounts of data, which have nothing to do with the service they provide,\u201d said Aditya Narang, co-founder of cybersecurity firm SafeHouse Technologies.\n\n(With inputs from Agencies)","title":"India bans 43 more Chinese apps - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/26/144280/","video":[]}
