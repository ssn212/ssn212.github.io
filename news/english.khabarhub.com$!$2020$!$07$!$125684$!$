It undermines the health, dignity, security and autonomy of its victims, yet it remains shrouded in a culture of silence.\n\nPhase I gave us a lot of hope and encouragement that change is possible with sustained support,\u201d said Ms. Lubna Baqi, UNFPA Country Representative in Nepal. Violence against women and girls, be it emotional, physical, sexual or financial is borne from deeply-rooted discriminatory practices that value men and boys and normalize violence against women and girls.\n\n\u201cPromoting gender equality and non-discrimination is one of Switzerland\u2019s key priorities and therefore we are keen to support this project which will work with men, women, boys and girls to address such negative social beliefs and unjust practices,\u201d noted Ms. Silvana Hogg, Charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires of the Embassy of Switzerland in Nepal.\n\nNepal has made significant strides towards ensuring gender equality and ending gender-based discrimination and violence through policy and legislative measures. However, more still needs to be done to put the provisions of these legal instruments into reality on the ground.\n\n\u201cAdvancing women\u2019s rights and gender equality is an important priority for the Government of Norway. Violence against women can never be accepted, never excused, never tolerated,\u201d says Mr. Lasse Bj\u00f8rn Johannessen, the Ambassador of the Norwegian Embassy in Kathmandu.
