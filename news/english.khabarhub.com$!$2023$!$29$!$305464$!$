Tehran rejects the allegations.\n\nInitially, Iran denied supplying Shahed drones to Russia but later said it had provided a small number before the conflict began. Ukraine has said Russia has used the drones in major attacks on cities and infrastructure.\n\nOvernight Saturday, Russia launched the \u201cmost massive attack\u201d on the city with Iranian-made Shahed drone, said Serhii Popko, a senior Kyiv military official. The attack lasted more than five hours, with air defense reportedly shooting down 52 out of 54 drones, demonstrating Ukraine\u2019s air defense capability.\n\n(VOA)","title":"Ukraine proposes massive sanctions against Iran","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/29/305464/","video":[]}
