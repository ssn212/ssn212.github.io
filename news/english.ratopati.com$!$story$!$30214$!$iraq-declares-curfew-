The KDP is a Kurdish political party close to Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani.\n\nSaad al-Baiyati, an officer from Kirkuk provincial police, told Xinhua that the two sides clashed in front of the KDP's former headquarters, prompting the security forces to intervene to stop the riots.\n\nHowever, gunshots, suspected to have been fired from the Kurdish side, led to security forces responding with gunfire, resulting in the death of one Kurdish protester and the injury of another, according to al-Baiyati.\n\nThe Arabs and Turkmens have been protesting over the past few days against the return of the KDP, including blocking streets, setting tires on fire, and staging a sit-in outside the building to prevent the KDP from reclaiming their headquarters.\n\nThe clashes are the latest in a series of tensions between the Kurds, Arabs, and Turkmens in Kirkuk, a city located in an oil-rich region that is claimed by both the Kurdistan region and the central government in Baghdad.\n\nIn October 2017, former Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi instructed government forces to enter Kirkuk Province and reclaim authority over the disputed areas between the Baghdad government and the regional Kurdish government.\n\nThe move was taken in response to a controversial referendum held by the Kurds on the independence of the Kurdistan Region and the disputed areas.\n\nThe Kurds consider the northern Kirkuk province and parts of Nineveh, Diyala, and Salahudin provinces as disputed areas and want them to be incorporated into their region, a move fiercely opposed by the Arabs and Turkmens as well as the central government.","title":"Iraq declares curfew in northern province after ethnical clashes","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/30214/iraq-declares-curfew-","video":[]}
