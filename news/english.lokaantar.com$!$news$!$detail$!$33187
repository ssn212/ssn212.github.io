It was joined by 150 representatives from three international organizations and 21 countries including Pakistan.\n\nAt the assembly, the Alliance for Cultural Heritage in Asia was officially launched and a joint declaration on cultural heritage protection in Asia released.\n\nAccording to the declaration, parties involved should carry out wide cooperation on promoting urban and rural cultural heritage conservation, joint archaeology, relics repair, combating illicit trafficking of cultural property, development of cultural heritage conservation technologies and training of young talents, based on the principles of mutual respect, equality, inclusiveness, opening and mutual learning.\n\nSince Xi proposed for making efforts to conserve cultural heritage in Asia in 2019, China and other Asian countries have implemented a series of projects of the cooperation on cultural heritage conservation.\n\nFor instance, Art Exhibitions China has hosted the \"Three Kingdoms Unveiling the Story\" exhibition in Japan; The Palace Museum, in cooperation with relevant departments in Pakistan, has launched the \"Gandgara Heritage along the Silk Road\" exhibition in the Forbidden City.\n\nMembers of a Chinese archaeological team work in an excavation site in Pakistan.

China has signed cooperation documents on cultural heritage conservation with Pakistan and South Korea, and launched senior online training programs on the conservation of stone relics together with Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nNasir Khan, Deputy head of the Department of Archaeology and Museums of the National Heritage and Culture Division of Pakistan, noted that China has always helped Pakistan train professionals and shared with the latter its technological experiences of cultural relics conservation. China has offered opportunities for Pakistani professionals of cultural relics conservation to host exhibitions in China, which is conducive to introducing Pakistani culture to a larger group of audience.\n\nAt present, the \"Gandgara Heritage along the Silk Road\" exhibition is currently held at the Palace Museum in Beijing. Fareena Mazhar, Secretary of the National Heritage and Culture Division of Pakistan, called the exhibition an achievement of the joint efforts made by China and Pakistan.\n\nShe said the exhibition is a great outcome of China-Pakistan cultural exchanges and has received wide attention.\n\nAccording to statistics, China has launched 11 relics repair projects in cooperation with Cambodia, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Nepal, Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan over the past four years.\n\nBesides, China has also carried out 33 joint archaeological projects with 19 countries including the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia, which involved the studies of major civilization routes and systems such as the land and maritime Silk Road.\n\nPeople visit the \"Gandgara Heritage along the Silk Road\" exhibition held at the Palace Museum in Beijing.
