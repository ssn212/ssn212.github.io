The number accounted for 4.7 percent of China's foreign trade in the same period, 1.7 percentage points higher from a year ago.\n\nThe exports of these products helped raise China's overall export growth by 2 percentage points and promoted the optimization of China's foreign trade structure.","title":"China's foreign trade shows strong vitality","url":"http://english.lokaantar.com/news/detail/33185","video":[]}
