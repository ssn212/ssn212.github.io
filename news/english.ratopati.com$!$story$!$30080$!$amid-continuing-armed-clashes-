The independent Sudan Tribune news portal reported on its website that the SAF on Sunday intensified its air and artillery strikes against the RSF posts in various areas of the capital Khartoum.\n\nThe SAF has repulsed three RSF attacks at the army's armored corps camp in the Al-Shajara military area, south of Khartoum. The camp has been a major target for the RSF, where it had made several attempts to control it over the last week.\n\nThe SAF warplanes also targeted the RSF positions around Khartoum International Airport and the army's General Command in central Khartoum, an eyewitness told Xinhua.\n\nThe Eastern Nile Emergency Room, east of Khartoum, announced in a statement on Sunday that several citizens were injured in the Al-Haj Yousif neighborhood due to the falling of shells.\n\nSimilarly, South Khartoum Emergency Room said in a statement that 7 citizens were killed when a shell fell in the vicinity of the central market in southern Khartoum.\n\nSudan has been witnessing deadly armed clashes between the SAF and the RSF in Khartoum and other areas since April 15, which left over 3,000 people killed and more than 6,000 injured, according to the Sudanese Health Ministry.\n\nMore than 4 million people have fled from their homes -- 3.2 million people were displaced internally and close to 900,000 have crossed the border into Chad, Egypt, South Sudan and other countries, according to the latest UN estimates.","title":"Momentum for political settlement increases amid continuing armed clashes in Sudan","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/30080/amid-continuing-armed-clashes-","video":[]}
