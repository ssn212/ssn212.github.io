Ltd said, \u201cCustomer complaints about slow internet are justified. Internet service providers may offer more bandwidth than they can afford due to fierce competition, but many of the problems are not just our fault,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Saud, Nepal\u2019s service providers are just a bridge between consumers, servers and apps, and if one of these three parties has a problem, the internet slows down.\n\nSimilarly, Vinay Bohora, Managing Director at Vianet Communications Pvt. Ltd., said that the complaints of consumers about internet slowdown would never end.\n\nHe said, \u201cInternet is slow now because of excessive use of TikTok. Another app similar to this will be available in future and the problems may arise again.\u201d\n\nBohora admits that sometimes customers may not get quality internet due to unhealthy competition between internet service providers.\n\nTelecommunications expert Anandaraj Khanal said that one should be satisfied with the services provided by ISPs amidst many shortages in the country.\n\nDuring the epidemic, developed countries have taken many initiatives other than increasing bandwidth to improve the quality of the internet, he said.\n\nHowever, Khanal has accused the government of doing nothing for the quality of the internet rather than instructing ISPs to provide discounts to consumers.","title":"Why has internet become sluggish in Nepal? - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/05/125274/","video":[]}
