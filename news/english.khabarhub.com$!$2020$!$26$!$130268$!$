(File Photo)\n\nJAJARKOT: Locals in Shiwalaya Rural Municipality in the western part of Jajarkot district have no other choices except for making a perilous journey in tuin (rope bridge) over the Chedgada River to travel to nearby village Karki Gaun at Chedgaad Municipality in the district for years.\n\nKali Bahadur Pun of Shiwalaya Rural Municipality-1 in the district shared that he had been commuting in tuin in absence of a bridge over the Chedgaad River.\n\nAlthough the locals have been demanding for bridge to replace the tuin, the local administration was yet to pay heed to their plight.\n\nThe tuin ride is very risky and inconvenient, especially in the monsoon when the water level in the river rises, said the locals.\n\nThat\u2019s when most of the locals in Karki Gaun and Shiwalayala Rural Municipality opt to take a five-hour walk and cross a suspension bridge at Morka in their rural municipality to reach Karki Gaun.\n\n\u201cMany people have lost their lives while travelling in boat to cross the river. Although tuin has made travel easier since it was installed 25 years ago, it still appears to be a nuisance for the women, children and elderly,\u201d shared Ram Bahadur Khattri of Karki Gaun.\n\nIt takes the locals here around an hour and half to reach the nearest suspension bridge. Some people also have lost their lives while opting to tread the rugged trail in the locality instead of crossing the river on tuins, the local said.\n\nThe locals have called for the attention of the government towards their plight and ensure them a viable and safe transport system replacing the tuin.\n\nRSS","title":"Locals in Jajarkot still using tuin to cross river for years - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/26/130268/","video":[]}
