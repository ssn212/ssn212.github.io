The glacial lake is divided by the de facto frontier between the rivals and is one of the three sites where the India-China faceoff began in early May.\n\nThe statement said Indian troops \u201cundertook measures to strengthen our positions and thwart Chinese intentions to unilaterally change facts on ground.\u201d\n\nChina did not immediately comment.\n\nThe statement said the two countries local military commanders met along the disputed frontier on Monday to \u201cresolve the issues.\u201d It said India was committed to dialogue \u201cbut is also equally determined to protect its territorial integrity.\u201d\n\nSeveral rounds of military and diplomatic talks to end the current crisis in Ladakh have been unsuccessful.\n\nThe disputed and undemarcated 3,500-kilometer (2,175-mile) border between India and China stretches from Ladakh in the north to the Indian state of Sikkim. The two Asia giants fought a border war in 1962 that also spilled into Ladakh. The two countries have been trying to settle their border dispute since the early 1990s, without success.\n\nThe ongoing standoff high in the Karakoram mountains is over disputed portions of a pristine landscape that boasts the world\u2019s highest landing strip, a glacier that feeds one of the largest irrigation systems in the world, and a critical link to China\u2019s massive \u201cBelt and Road\u201d infrastructure project.\n\nThe faceoff began at three places. Soldiers at the 134 kilometers- (84-miles) long scenic lake ignored repeated verbal warnings, triggering a yelling match, stone-throwing and even fistfights. By June it escalated and spread to two other places toward the north in Depsang and Galwan Valley where India has built an all-weather military road along the disputed frontier.\n\nOn June 15, the situation turned deadly when the rival troops engaged in a nighttime medieval clash in Galwan.\n\nAccording to Indian officials, Chinese troops atop a ridge at the mouth of the narrow valley threw stones, punched and pushed Indian soldiers down a ridge at around 4,500 meters (15,000 feet) leaving 20 Indians dead, including a colonel. China did not report any casualties.\n\nIt was the deadliest conflict in 45 years between the nuclear-armed rivals. Accusing each other of instigating the violence, both sides pledged to safeguard their territory but also to try to end the standoff that dramatically changed India-China bilateral relationship.","title":"India accuses China of 'provocative' military activities","url":"http://en.setopati.com/political/153796","video":[]}
