Lombardy still accounts for around a third of the dead in Italy, which has the continent\u2019s worst confirmed virus toll at nearly 72,000 dead.\n\n\u201cToday is a beautiful, symbolic day: All the citizens of Europe together are starting to get their vaccinations, the first ray of light after a long night,\u201d Arcuri told reporters outside the hospital.\n\nBut he cautioned: \u201cWe all have to continue to be prudent, cautious and responsible. We still have a long road ahead, but finally we see a bit of light.\u201d\n\nThe vaccines, developed by Germany\u2019s BioNTech and American drugmaker Pfizer, started arriving in super-cold containers at EU hospitals on Friday from a factory in Belgium. Each country was only getting a fraction of the doses needed \u2014 fewer than 10,000 in the first batches \u2014 with the bigger rollout expected in January when more vaccines become available.\n\nIn the Los Olmos nursing home in the Spanish city of Guadalajara, northeast of Madrid, 96-year-old resident Araceli Hidalgo and a caregiver were the first Spaniards to receive the vaccine. Like Italy, Spain has been one of the hardest-hit countries in Europe, with nursing homes a major source of infection.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see if we can all behave and make this virus go away,\u201d Hidalgo said after receiving her injection.\n\nThe Los Olmos home suffered two confirmed COVID-19 deaths and another 11 deaths among residents with symptoms who were never tested during the chaotic initial months.\n\n\u201cWhat we want is for as many people as possible to get vaccinated,\u201d said M\u00f3nica Tapias, the 48-year-old worker at the home. \u201cWe have lost some residents here to COVID, and that has been very sad. Let\u2019s see if this can finally finish with this.\u201d\n\nThe Czech Republic was spared the worst of the pandemic in the spring only to see its health care system near collapse in the fall. In Prague, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis received his shot at dawn Sunday and asserted: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d Sitting next to him was World War II veteran Emilie Repikova, who also received the shot.\n\nAltogether, the EU\u2019s 27 nations have recorded at least 16 million coronavirus infections and more than 336,000 deaths \u2014 huge numbers that experts say still understate the true toll of the pandemic due to missed cases and limited testing.\n\nAll those getting shots will have to come back in three weeks for a second dose.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen released a video Saturday celebrating the vaccine rollout, calling it \u201ca touching moment of unity.\u201d The vaccination campaign should ease frustrations that were building up, especially in Germany, as Britain, Canada and the United States kicked off their inoculation programs with the same vaccine weeks earlier.\n\nAs it turned out, some EU immunizations began a day early in Germany, Hungary and Slovakia. The operator of a German nursing home where dozens of people were vaccinated Saturday, including a 101-year-old woman, said \u201cevery day that we wait is one day too many.\u201d\n\nEach EU country decided on its own who will get the first shots, with most vowing to put health care workers and nursing home residents first.\n\nEU leaders are counting on the vaccine rollout to help the bloc project a sense of unity in a complex lifesaving mission after it faced a year of difficulties in negotiating a post-Brexit trade deal with Britain.\n\nAustrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz called the vaccines \u2014 which were developed in record time \u2014 a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that today is not the end of the pandemic, but it is the beginning of the victory,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong the politicians who got shots Sunday to promote a wider acceptance of vaccinations was Bulgarian Health Minister Kostadin Angelov.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see my 70-year-old father without fear that I could infect him,\u201d Angelov said.\n\nMeanwhile, a new virus variant that has been spreading rapidly around London and southern England has now been detected France, Spain, Canada and Japan. The new variant, which British authorities said is much more easily transmitted, has caused many countries to put new restrictions on those coming from Britain.\n\nJapan announced it would temporarily ban all non-resident foreigners from entering through Jan. 31 as a precaution against the U.K.\u2019s new variant.\n\nGermany\u2019s BioNTech has said it\u2019s confident that its vaccine works against the new U.K. variant, but added that further studies are needed to be completely certain.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency on Jan. 6 will consider approving another coronavirus vaccine made by Moderna, which is already being used in the United States.\n\nAndreas Raouna, 84, said he was honored to be among the first to get the shot in Cyprus and criticized vaccine skeptics of being \u201cin league with a murderer.\u201d\n\nWhile there may be some side-effects, he said, \u201cif the coronavirus hits you, it\u2019ll be the end of you.\u201d","title":"EU kicks off COVID-19 vaccine campaign","url":"http://en.setopati.com/social/154724","video":[]}
