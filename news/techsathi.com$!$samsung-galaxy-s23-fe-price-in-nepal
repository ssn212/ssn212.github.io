It has a 240Hz touch sampling rate in game mode. The IP68 rating makes it dust and water-resistant.\n\nWith 8.2mm thickness and 209g weight, the phone offers a slim and lightweight design. The rear camera module blends seamlessly into the back panel. Available colors are Graphite, Lavender, Mint, White, and Lime.\n\nPerformance and Software\n\nPowering the Galaxy S23 FE is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 mobile platform paired with 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage.

The phone shines with its vibrant 120Hz AMOLED display, reliable Snapdragon 888 performance, and versatile camera setup.\n\nFast charging support and an IP68 rating add to the appeal. However, 25W charging seems slow for a 2023 device. The availability of just one RAM/storage configuration is also limiting.\n\nIn Nepal, the Galaxy S23 FE is expected to launch soon given Samsung\u2019s strong market presence. It will provide an alternative for buyers wanting S series features like display and cameras without spending over NPR 1 lakh.\n\nOverall, the Galaxy S23 FE succeeds as a toned-down yet capable version of the flagship S23 series for budget-conscious buyers. Samsung fans in Nepal can look forward to the S23 FE as an affordable premium offering.","title":"Samsung Launches Galaxy S23 FE with Snapdragon 888 and 120Hz AMOLED Display","url":"http://techsathi.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-price-in-nepal","video":[]}
