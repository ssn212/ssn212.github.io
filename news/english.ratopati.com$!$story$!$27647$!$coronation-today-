This will be the first coronation in Britain in 70 years. The preparation of the program has reached its final stage. King Charles and the Queen Consort are preparing for their royal visit to Westminster Abbey.\n\nDespite the possibility of rain, the route of the royal journey has gotten crowded. Due to this, tight security arrangements have been made in Central London. About 100 heads of government will participate in the ceremony. Foreign Minister NP Saud has reached Britain from Nepal. However, those opposing the monarchy have also appealed to protest during this period.\n\nThe coronation ceremony will last for about two hours and will be attended by 2300 guests, including the Duke of Sussex Prince Harry who arrived from America on Friday.","title":"Coronation of King Charles III today","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/27647/coronation-today-","video":[]}
