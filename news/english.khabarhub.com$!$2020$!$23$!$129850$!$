(Fule Photo)\n\nKATHMANDU: While protests at different levels are going on regarding India\u2019s encroachment of Nepali land in different places, another neighbor China has also allegedly constructed buildings illegally by encroaching upon the Nepali land in Humla.\n\nAccording to Namkha Rural Municipality\u2019s Mayor Vishnu Bahadur Tamang (Lama), China\u2019s 9 business complexes are in the last phase of construction at Namkha-6, Lapcha.\n\nHe informed that China had constructed two buildings a few years back. According to Mayor Lama, Border Pillar 11 lies in the place China has constructed the complexes now.\n\nChina constructed 11 business complexes in the Nepali land, Lama further said adding that the sophisticated buildings have the solar power backup and have spacious compounds as well.\n\nThe construction site lies at Namkha-6 in Limi Lapcha, a village lying beyond the Himalayas.\n\nNepali youths have staged a demonstration in front of Chinese Embassy at Baluwatar in Kathmandu saying that China encroached the Nepali territory.\n\nLama informed that the construction site actually lies 2 km in from the border on the Nepali side. \u201cThe border pillars in that area were constructed and fixed in 1962, but some of the pillars are missing,\u201d he told Khabarhub.\n\n\u201cThe pillar number 12 is there but the pillar 11 is missing,\u201d he said adding that they have assigned people to look for it.\n\nIt is learned that a high-level team, including the Chief District Officer of Humla, has gone to the construction site.\n\nHowever, owing to the uneven topography, it takes more than 2 days to cover a distance of 105 km.\n\nMayor Lama, who has recently returned from the area, is sad to see that the area that used to be used by the Nepalis have not only encroached by the Chinese side but also the Nepalis are prohibited to visit it since few days.\n\n\u201cWe are restricted from going to the area we had been using, the Chinese Army does not let Nepalis go there now,\u201d he said with a sigh.\n\nHe said that the construction site lies 2 km in from the border on the Nepali side.\n\nHowever, China has made claims that the construction site and 1 km more from there belong to it. \u201cThey even stopped us 1 km further away from the construction site. They have even made a compound around the area,\u201d Mayor Lama said.\n\nChina has deployed as many 35 army personnel in the construction site whereas there is a presence of Nepali security forces in the area.\n\nHowever, there is no Nepali security post in the area. The only police post close to the area is 2 days away from there. Although the Pillar no. 11 is lost, others are being guarded by the locals.\n\nWhen Lama tried to inquire more about the purpose of construction, the Chinese side responded that the construction was not for the sake of the army but for business purposes.\n\nChina claims that Lapcha is on the Chinese map for quite a long time. According to Mayor Lama, the Nepali side headed by CDO Chiranjivi Giri and Mayor Lama himself had held a dialogue with the Chinese side on Saturday.\n\nHe informed that the Chinese side strongly claimed the part as theirs and even claimed 1 km in from the construction site saying it is on the Chinese map. \u201cThey not only claimed the area but even said that,\u201d Mayor Lama told Khabarhub.\n\n\u201cNepalis people are not allowed to go there,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Department of Survey uninformed\n\nThe pillars are lost, the area is encroached upon but the Department of Survey, which is authorized to keep the record of the territory is unaware of it all.\n\n\u201cAlthough we have unofficially heard about Chinese construction at the border area, I don\u2019t know much about it,\u201d Damodar Dhakal, the information officer at the Department of Survey.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a border dispute with China,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, issuing a press release on June 25 has reiterated that there is no dispute with China.\n\n\u201cThere is no border dispute with China, the disputes in some areas in Humla and other parts were settled in 1961,\u201d the Ministry had said in its statement.\n\nProtest in Kathmandu\n\nMeanwhile, Nepali youths have staged a demonstration in front of Chinese Embassy at Baluwatar in Kathmandu saying that China encroached the Nepali territory.\n\nShouting slogans, \u2018Stop Border Encroachment\u2019, \u2018Return the Encroached Nepali Land\u2019, \u2018Open Nepal-China Border\u2019, \u2018Down with Chinese Imperialism\u2019, a large number of Nepali youths have hit the streets against China in the capital this morning.","title":"Chinese authority bars Nepalis from visiting encroached land; Border Pillar 11 missing in Humla - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/23/129850/","video":[]}
