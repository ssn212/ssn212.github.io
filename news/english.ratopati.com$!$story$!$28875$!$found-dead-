In February, Ryuchell appeared in a YouTube video alongside Peco, who defended her ex-husband and said she supported them as they worked out their sexuality.\n\nRyuchell became an influential LGBT figure in Japan and was well-known for their genderless style of dressing. As they became more famous, they were subject to numerous online social harassment campaigns which largely criticised their personal life and gender non-conformity.\n\nShortly after their death, terms like \"Ryuchell\" and \"character assassination\" started trending on Twitter in Japan, with many expressing shock and sadness.\n\nOne user called Ryuchell a shining light in a harsh world and referred to suicide as being preventable.\n\nPeco and their son are overseas - on Tuesday she posted a picture of a cake for his fifth birthday. The family is yet to comment on news of Ryuchell's death.\n\n(BBC)","title":"Ryuchell: Japanese TV personality found dead at agent's office","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/28875/found-dead-","video":[]}
