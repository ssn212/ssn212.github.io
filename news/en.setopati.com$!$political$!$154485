We second generation leaders are ready to handle the posts of chairman and prime minister,\" Pun said inaugurating a Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) sub-station in Lakuri of Rolpa on Monday. \"They should be able to say that. We are ready to accept them as guardians. But this should not be done in emotion and rage, and should be concluded in a systematic manner. We are ready for that.\"\n\nPointing that the dispute in ruling CPN has affected the politics of the whole country, he stressed that party unity will not be weakened as unification was done with the people's mandate. \"There are concerns that there may be problems in the country due to the dispute in the party, but we will not let that happen. We will not allow the rights granted by the Constitution lost,\" he assured.\n\n\"The debate inside the party is on high flow at times and minimal at others. This takes the party to unchartered territory. The central committee will resolve minor disputes while we will resolve big disputes through the general convention.\"\n\nCPN Chairmen KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal have resorted to making formal allegations against each other in the secretariat meeting.\n\nOli challenged fellow Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal to legally prove corruption allegations or apologize for the allegations or be ready to face punishment if he doesn't apologize.\n\nOli stated in his response that criminal allegations cannot be discussed politically and said the party should adopt legal way for criminal accusations. He added that the criminal allegations should either be proved or there should be apology on that or Dahal should face punishment for groundless allegations if he doesn't apologize.\n\nOli also accused Dahal of nepotism in his response to Dahal's political proposal that he presented to the secretariat meeting Saturday afternoon. \"There is nepotism in you. Making daughter-in-law minister, daughter mayor and nephew ambassador is not socialism,\" Oli's report accuses.\n\nDahal had presented a 19-page proposal with consent of the majority of secretariat members during the secretariat meeting on November 13 criticizing CPN Chairman and Prime Minister (PM) KP Sharma Oli and slamming him for failing to properly run both the government and the party. He has also made corruption allegations against Oli in the proposal.\n\nOli has announced end of past agreements and understanding with fellow Dahal after the proposal and those in the Oli camp have been demanding withdrawal of the proposal.\n\nOli demanded time to respond to the political proposal submitted by Dahal during the last secretariat meeting on November 18. He claimed that Dahal's proposal has baselessly made serious allegations against him and he will have to respond to that with preparations.\n\nThe meeting, therefore, decided to give him 10 days to draft the response. Oli will present his response in the secretariat meeting today and both Dahal's proposal and Oli's response will be discussed in the meeting.\n\nThe party has also called standing committee meeting five days later and central committee meeting another seven days later.\n\nThe ruling party is again facing a grave crisis with Dahal claiming that PM Oli has proposed to split the ruling party even as Oli is in minority in parliamentary party, secretariat, standing committee and central committee.\n\nDahal, Khanal, Nepal and Shrestha have been together in the fight against Oli all the time while Gautam keeps on changing camps. Gautam is angry with Oli now after he was not inducted in the Cabinet in the latest Cabinet reshuffle.\n\nSources close to Oli, however, have claimed that Dahal has demanded the post of PM.\n\nDahal is reportedly aggrieved about the Karnali dispute, Cabinet reshuffle, Oli's meeting with Chief of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) Samant Kumar Goel, murder of a party cadre in Parsa and other issues.\n\nOli and Dahal had signed a five-point agreement at the time of unification of the then CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) on May 17, 2018. The two parties had unified to form CPN the next day on the basis of the five-point agreement.\n\nThe fourth point of the agreement mentioned that the two chairmen will lead the government as necessary on the basis of equality and equal period.\n\nBut Dahal had relinquished his claim for the post of PM after the two chairmen signed an agreement on division of responsibilities in presence of President Bidhya Devi Bhandari on November 20, 2019.\n\nDahal was made chairman with executive rights. Oli and Dahal were to remain chairmen, and Oli to continue to be ranked top but Oli had handed over the executive rights to Dahal.\n\nDahal was to lead the party and chair party meetings while Oli would lead the government through the current term of House of Representatives, according to the agreement.\n\nThe party was then on the verge of split with Dahal aggrieved that Oli continues to run even the party unilaterally and the overwhelming majority of members during the last standing committee meeting seeking resignation of PM Oli.\n\nThe two chairmen then formed a six-strong task force in August to resolve internal dispute in the party. The standing committee meeting then took decision on the basis of the report submitted by the task force that recommended that Oli would serve the full five-year term as PM and Dahal would take the wheel of the party.\n\nDahal was to be fully active in party works but required to consult PM Oli who will remain a sort of ceremonial chairman. Similarly, PM Oli was required to move the government works forward consulting Dahal.\n\nBut Oli has unilaterally made appointments of ambassadors and reshuffled Cabinet without endorsement of Dahal since the standing committee decision.","title":"Second generation ready to take over if Oli, Dahal step aside: Pun","url":"http://en.setopati.com/political/154485","video":[]}
