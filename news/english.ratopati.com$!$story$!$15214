Only remaining works to be fixed at the airport include installing lights and equipment. With this, the airport has witnessed 92 percent physical progress and 63 percent financial progress. Had there been no COVID-19 pandemic the airport would have come to its final preparation for operating commercial flights.\n\nThe technical works of the project construction has been delayed at the airport due to COVID-19. However, other physical works did not let up amidst the lockdown. Project Chief of the International Airport Prabesh Adhikari said the technical works are very indeed challenging. Though most of the equipment have arrived the challenge lies in importing technical human resource from abroad for no international flights in operation, he added. The task of devising equipment inside the terminal building of the airport is yet to be done.\n\nFixing baggage handling, passenger security screening machine and Air Condition are still in the process. Making public the annual progress report recently, Minster for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Yogesh Bhattarai said the airport construction is gaining momentum and necessary efforts are underway to expedite remaining works in the airport. The Nepal Airlines Corporation, the regulatory body of aviation sector, has said that the international airport would come into operation at the onset of 2021 AD.","title":"Gautam Buddha airport sees 92 percent physical progress; gaining technical progress still a challenge","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/15214","video":[]}
