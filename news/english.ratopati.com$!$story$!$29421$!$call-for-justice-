However, Public Prosecutor Ghassan Oweidat considered the charges void, saying the judiciary has not yet decided on cases calling for Bitar's suspension from probing the case or transferring the investigation to another judge.\n\nThe Beirut port was rocked by two massive explosions on Aug. 4, 2020, killing over 220 people, injuring thousands, and destroying around 50,000 housing units with material losses estimated at 15 billion U.S. dollars.","title":"Lebanese commemorate Beirut port blasts, call for justice for victims","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/29421/call-for-justice-","video":[]}
