He put his view in the meeting of the House of Representatives today. \"I request for a ruling regarding the dissemination of information on ongoing action in the case,\" he said.\n\nNo one involved in the scam should be let on the loose under any pretexts, he said. \"How the fake Bhutanese refugee scam is unfolding is not only related to financial corruption or digits. This is an organised crime against the State. This is a kind of heinous crime related to fraud. No one involved in it should be given an escape under any circumstances.\"\n\nStating that arguments were making the rounds that whether the police would launch investigations into the matter itself or hand over the responsibility to the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority, he warned that the government should not commit any such wrongdoings.\n\nIt was a matter of shame that high profile people including former Home Ministers and deputy Prime Minister are found to have been involved in heinous crimes like the fake Bhutanese refugee that has drawn the attention of both the country and the international community, and brought the country insult, he commented.","title":"Parliament be informed about ongoing action in fake Bhutanese refugee scam: Demands RPP Chair Lingden","url":"http://english.lokaantar.com/news/detail/33171","video":[]}
