A meeting of the District COVID Crisis Management Centre and District Security Committee held at the District Administration Office Baitadi on Sunday decided to ease and extend the restriction enforcement up to September 16.\n\nThe order issued by Chief District Officer Mohan Raj Joshi following the meeting has also stated what are allowed to do and what not. A decision was made to allow the operation of all types of shops from 6.00 am to 6.00 pm by mandatorily wearing masks, using sanitizer and maintaining social distance.\n\nCDO Joshi shared the vehicular operation would be permitted under the odd and even number system and the restriction enforcement would also be monitored. \u201cWe have slightly relaxed the restriction to ease life. But it does not mean not to adopt health safety measures. I urge one and all for strictly embracing health safety precautions though the restriction enforcement is relaxed\u201d, he added. Number of coronavirus infection cases has reached 375 in Baitadi district in the Sudurpaschim State of Nepal.","title":"Restriction eased and extended up to September 16 in Baitadi","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/15132","video":[]}
