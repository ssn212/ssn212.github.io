Hundreds of houses would be inundated. Sodari said the river started eroding the embankment rapidly as it was weak although constructed a year back.\n\n\u201cThe river will wreak havoc in the settlements if measures are not taken to controlling the erosion. About 100 metres of the embankment is vulnerable.\n\nIf the embankment collapses, the water from the river will start gushing towards the settlements,\u201d Sodari warned.\n\nMeanwhile, a team comprising Tikapur municipality mayor Tapendra Bahadur Rawal, representatives of the irrigation project and the project\u2019s technicians has inspected the site.\n\nMayor Rawal said after the inspection that the settlements are at risk and the municipality\u2019s disaster prevention committee has decided to construct embankment using bio engineering method.\n\nHe said the municipality would also ask for help from the District Disaster Management Committee in this connection.
