This includes making four routes to the north easier.\n\nThe agreement to increase the already agreed or negotiated programs with China was announced by the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transportation. The preparation to build the roads connecting Nepal and China, including the Kathmandu-Kerung railway, will be discussed during the visit.\n\nWhile the commitment made during the Nepal Prime Minister\u2019s visit to China and the agreement of the Chinese President with Nepal has not seen significant progress, the work on the Kerung-Kathmandu railway\u2019s alignment has been completed. There isn\u2019t much hope for immediate progress despite discussions.\n\nAlthough the work on the Kerung-Kathmandu railway alignment has been completed, the Kerung-Kathmandu-Rasuwagadhi railway project has been stalled due to various issues. The Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transportation has expressed its faith in the construction of the railway from Kerung to Kathmandu and Rasuwagadhi to be discussed during the Prime Minister\u2019s China visit.\n\nRohit Kumar Bisuraula, the Director-General of the Railway Department, mentioned that there\u2019s no location for railway-related hopes during the Prime Minister\u2019s China visit.\n\nSurkhet-Hilsa Road in a Priority\n\nThe Simikot-Hilsa road, connecting western Nepal to China, will receive priority for construction. Plans to connect the Karnali Corridor with two lanes and increase its level of improvement in partnership with China have been made.\n\nPlans to construct the Hilsa-Simikot road to facilitate Nepali and Indian tourists visiting Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar are in progress.\n\nEven though progress has been made in three phases until the China border from Simikot, much work remains to be done. The Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transportation has the confidence to complete the work on this physical infrastructure and transportation plan.\n\n\u201cThe completion of approximately 5 kilometers of the road is awaited in one stretch, and even though the work may be done in 2-3 phases, it\u2019s important to maintain momentum,\u201d said Arjun Jung Thapa, the Chief of the Foreign Affairs Division in the Ministry.\n\nSupport for the Tokha-Chahare-Surung Marg\n\nDiscussions will be held regarding the two roads connecting directly with Kathmandu at the level of the Nepal\u2013China border. The construction of the Tokha-Rasuwa Ghadhi road, part of the Tokha-Chhahare-Surung Marg, will also be discussed. Although there is a black topped road from Tokha to Chhahare of Nuwakot, there is a circumstances where you must climb up and down.\n\nNuwakot District, which will become a municipality in the coming fiscal year, has set aside a budget of 1 billion rupees for this plan. Despite that, the possibility of foreign aid arriving to construct the Surung Marg (Tunnel route) remains viable.\n\nThe Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transportation has shown its commitment to the Prime Minister\u2019s visit by setting forth a plan that has been in place since before for the construction of the Surung Marg.\n\nThapa, the Secretary of the Ministry, stated, \u201cA kind of agreement was reached when the Chinese President was here. The Ministry\u2019s agreement to forward the agenda will also make the progress towards the construction of the Surung Marg agreeable!\u201d\n\nChina had already shown its commitment to assist in the construction of the Surung Marg up to Chhahare and Surung after Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s visit. Chinese officials from China Communications Construction Company studied the project. Similarly, there is a plan to upgrade the Arniko Highway from Dhulikhel to Tatopani, covering a distance of 86 kilometers.\n\n\u201cThe Arniko Highway towards the northern trading route is an Arniko road. Our proposal is to improve the road from Dhulikhel to Tatopani,\u201d added Thapa.\n\nThe region to the north of this road to Arniko is suitable for business. Thus, the proposal includes the upgrade of the Dhulikhel-Tatopani road.","title":"Prime Minister\u2019s China Visit : Priority Given to the Northern Border Road Link","url":"http://www.nepalpage.com/2023/09/01/219972/","video":[]}
