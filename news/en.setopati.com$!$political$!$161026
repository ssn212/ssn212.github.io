Khand\u2019s associate Narendra KC has also been arrested.\n\nAn audio recording claiming that money was paid to Khand\u2019s wife Manju Khand in the fake Bhutanese refugees scam has already been made public.\n\nPolice arrested Khand without getting an arrest warrant from the court suspecting he could abscond like CPN-UML Secretary Top Bahadur Rayamajhi who is fugitive after the Kathmandu District Court issued arrest warrant in his name.\n\nThe police held a discussion about whether to get the arrest warrant or not after concluding that Khand needs to be arrested in the scam. They then decided to arrest him by handing just an arrest memo from the police fearing he may abscond like Rayamajhi.\n\n\u201cWe have arrested him with an arrest memo concluding that the information about us going to the court for an arrest warrant could have been leaked and it could have been difficult to nab him,\u201d the Nepal Police source stated.\n\nThe police team then reached his residence with the arrest memo. Khand locked himself inside the house for a while after knowing that the team had arrived. Khand has been taken to the Kathmandu Police Range Teku. The police are preparing to go to the Kathmandu District Court to seek an arrest warrant.\n\nThe police said additional arrests could be made within the next couple of days.\n\nCPN-UML Secretary Top Bahadur Rayamajhi and son of UML Vice-chairman Ram Bahadur Thapa are absconding after issue of arrest warrants.\n\nNames of NC leader and former home minister Bal Krishna Khand, his wife and NC lawmaker Manju Khand and NC lawmaker Arzu Rana Deuba\u2014wife of NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba\u2014have also been dragged in the scam.","title":"Khand arrested without court's warrant due to fears he may abscond like Top Bahadur Rayamajhi","url":"http://en.setopati.com/political/161026","video":[]}
