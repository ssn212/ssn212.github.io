This is the first time Oli is visiting Prachanda\u2019s residence following his election as the Prime Minister.\n\nMeanwhile, the security condition has been tightened in and around Khumaltar area following the information that Prime Minister Oli is visiting Dahal\u2019s residence.\n\nPrime Minister\u2019s Khumaltar visit is viewed as meaningful at a time when the intra-party dispute of the ruling NCP has touched a new height, mainly after the government introduced an ordinance on the Constitutional Council.\n\nOn Friday evening, Prachanda had reached Baluwatar to meet another Chairman and Prime Minister KP Oli. During the one-on-one meeting that lasted for an hour dwelled on the implementation of the agreement reached between the two chairmen, according to Baluwatar sources.\n\nBoth Oli and Dahal-Nepal factions have intensified meetings of various levels across the country to turn the tables in their favor.\n\nDahal-Nepal faction held a gathering of district chairpersons and secretaries of Province 1 at Peris Danda on Friday. In the gathering, Dahal and Nepal directed the cadres to hit the streets against Oli if the Constitutional Council Ordinance were not withdrawn.\n\nLast week, Dahal-Nepal faction had organized a Bagmati Pradesh level gathering of its leaders. Relegated to minority in Secretariat Committee, Standing Committee and Central Committee, Prime Minister Oli, who is also the party chairman, is visiting Khumaltar to coax Dahal, according to political experts.","title":"PM Oli reaches Prachanda's residence as NCP feud deepens - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/19/150059/","video":[]}
