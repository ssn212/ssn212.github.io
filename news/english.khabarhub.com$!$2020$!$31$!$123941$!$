He added that three AWACS given to India is monitoring the airspace of Pakistan and they can see the land of Islamabad and Rawalpindi at this time. \u201cUnder these circumstances, it can be estimated where the next two AWACs will be deployed.\u201d\n\nIsrael-China AWACS Deal\n\nTwo decades ago, the US pressured Israel to scrap the AWACS deal because the spy plane would give China a strategic advantage over America\u2019s AWACS aircraft in any conflict over Taiwan. This acted as a major dent in Israel-China ties.\n\nChina\u2019s interest in Israel is strategic given the fact that the Jewish state is one of the world\u2019s foremost commercial, food, and security technology powerhouses and one of the few foreign countries to command significant grassroots support in the US.\n\nHowever, Israel cannot afford to weaken its ties with the US as it is a powerful support to the annexation of the West Bank.\n\nIndia\u2019s Need For AWACS\n\nAccording to S. Alex Philip, India first felt the need for AWACS during the air battle with Pakistan on February 27, 2019.\n\nFollowing the Balakot last year when Indian warplanes crossed the border and dropped bombs in the vicinity of the town of Balakot in Pakistan, the very next day, Pakistan tried to target military installations but was repulsed. Pakistan, which operates about 10 AWACS, took advantage of the system and succeeded in downing the Indian MiG-21 Bison in aerial combat besides capturing Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, who was handed over to India on March 1, 2019.\n\nNow the deal has finally received a green signal from India\u2019s Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS). The new PHALCON radar is going to be mounted on the Russian A-50 aircraft but will take two to three years for the delivery of the complete system.\n\nAlso termed as the Airborne Early-Warning and Control (AEW&C) aircraft, the AWACS are key systems of modern warfare as they can detect and track incoming fighters, cruise missiles, and drones much before ground-based radars, direct friendly fighters during air combat with enemy jets.\n\nThey also keep tabs on enemy troop build-ups and movement of warships. India\u2019s current possession of AWACS consists of three Phalcon AWACS, with a 400-km range and 360-degree coverage, and two indigenous \u201cNetra\u201d AEW&C aircraft, with indigenous 240-degree coverage radars with a 250-km range fitted on smaller Brazilian Embraer-145 jets.\n\nChinese AWACS\n\nThe Chinese AWACS include four Kong Jing-2000 (KJ-2000), four KJ-200, and two KJ-500 in the People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) as per Military Balance 2017. The PLA Navy has its own small fleet of AEW aircraft on the Y-8/Y-9 platform.\n\nAccording to Grp Captain RS Chhatwal, Chinese AWACS use Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technology which is more advanced than the technology used in AWACS built by the US and Russia.\n\n\u201cAgainst the PLAAF\u2019s ten AWACS/AEW aircraft, the IAF has three AWACS with two more in the pipeline. In addition, the IAF has inducted one Embraer EMB-145 AEW&C in February 2017 and has two more in the pipeline. The rectangular dual side airborne radar on this aircraft has been developed indigenously by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and is similar to China\u2019s KJ-200,\u201d he wrote comparing the Chinese and Indian AWACS capabilities.\n\nHowever, the acquisition of the AWACS is well-timed with the Indian Army preparing for a long haul at the LAC with China in Eastern Ladakh. The two nations have been at loggerheads ever since the deadly Galwan valley clash which resulted in the killing of 20 Indian soldiers and unconfirmed numbers on the Chinese side.\n\nHe further added that both the Chinese and Indian AWACS will suffer performance limitations in the mountains since undulations in the terrain will create detection problems for aircraft masked behind the hills.\n\n\u201cThe laws of physics are universally applicable and requirement of Line of Sight condition has to be met for radar pick up.\u201d Another limitation in the mountainous terrain at the LAC will due to terrain masking, AWACS may not be able to pick up any attackers heading towards it and the attackers can easily launch sneak attacks taking advantage of hill shadows in the area.\n\n(From inputs urasiantimes.com)","title":"Israel denies to sell AWACS to China but agrees to do so with India - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/31/123941/","video":[]}
