Formalization provides IWWs with legal recognition, including minimum wages and social security benefits.\n\nIt is estimated that there are around 10,000 to 15,000 IWWs in Kathmandu Valley alone. They are engaged in various waste-related activities.\n\nBased on their engagement, they can be categorized into four distinct groups: itinerant waste buyers, street waste pickers, waste pickers from collection vehicles, and waste pickers from dumpsites or landfill sites.\n\nThe itinerant waste buyers directly collect recyclable materials from various sources, mainly households and commercial places.\n\nThey act as intermediaries between waste generators and recycling facilities or middlemen. Street waste pickers handle valuable materials from streets and public places.\n\nWaste pickers from collection vehicles work directly with formal waste management services, sorting and recovering recyclables before they are sent to landfills.\n\nFinally, waste pickers from dumpsites or landfill sites recover recyclables, primarily from landfill sites.\n\nIWWs make a significant contribution to waste management in several ways. Firstly, they reduce the volume of waste sent to landfill sites.\n\nAdditionally, they play a crucial role in facilitating the movement of recyclables along the waste value chain.\n\nTheir efforts in waste recovery and recycling result in significant environmental benefits, contributing to a circular economy.\n\nIt is estimated that IWWs handle around 10% of solid waste in Kathmandu City and about 15% in Kathmandu Valley. The total municipal solid waste generation in Kathmandu Valley is estimated to be 1200 metric tonnes per day.\n\nAccording to UNEP, informal recycling in Jakarta (Bangladesh) has prevented 30% of waste from ending up in landfills, and in Delhi and Bangalore (India), it has kept 15% of waste away from landfills, saving the government around US$13,700 per day in waste collection and disposal costs.\n\nDespite their vital contribution, IWWs often remain unrecognized in waste management efforts. Their presence is sometimes considered detrimental to the image of a modern city.\n\nAdditionally, they face workplace harassment and lack job security and a safety net in case of illness. Family members associated with IWWs, especially their children, also bear the social cost of their parents\u2019 work by joining them and sacrificing their education.\n\nIWWs lack both the space and tools necessary for transporting recyclables in large quantities. As a result, they are compelled to sell in small quantities at lower prices.\n\nOpportunities for formalization abound, benefiting both IWWs and the city\u2019s waste management practices. Prioritizing resource recovery has the potential to expand the waste value chain.\n\nMost IWWs are highly vulnerable individuals who are socio-economically marginalized and disadvantaged. Consequently, they have limited access to healthcare, education, and other basic rights. Formalizing their work could help avoid such mishaps.\n\nAccording to the Solid Waste Management Act of 2068 (2011), engaging in waste management activities without proper authorization is considered an offense. Formalization provides IWWs with legal recognition, including minimum wages and social security benefits.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, IWWs work in risky conditions prone to injuries and chronic illness. Tasks involving carrying, loading, and unloading collectibles can be physically straining, yet they do not have any insurance to protect against such risks.\n\nFormalization can lead to improved workplace and personal safety, occupational health and safety training, and access to tools for a safe working environment.\n\nFormalization can also improve the negotiating power of IWWs for better prices, enable them to access storage facilities, and allow them to collectively sell when prices are high, promoting economic empowerment.\n\nEnhancing waste collection and recycling through the formalized engagement of IWWs could contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially those related to health, cities, the environment, and climate change.\n\nWhile there are strengths and opportunities in formalizing informal waste work in Nepal, there are also weaknesses and threats.\n\nThe formalization of IWWs plays a significant role in sustainable waste management. It requires a comprehensive approach that addresses social, financial, technical, and environmental dimensions.\n\nThe strength lies in IWWs\u2019 extensive knowledge of the supply chain. They have years of experience and are present in major urban areas across Nepal.\n\nOpportunities for formalization abound, benefiting both IWWs and the city\u2019s waste management practices. Prioritizing resource recovery has the potential to expand the waste value chain.\n\nNonetheless, navigating administrative hurdles during registration remains a daunting task, given IWWs\u2019 basic understanding of such processes. Furthermore, potential conflicts with established formal sectors could hinder the formalization of their work.\n\nThe formalization of IWWs is a complex process that requires careful consideration.\n\nThe primary bottlenecks in formalization include susceptibility to market fluctuations due to a lack of essential resources such as storage and processing facilities, and technical support. Formalizing may also entail tax obligations.\n\nThe absence of awareness programs regarding the importance of proper waste management and the role of local communities as waste generators hampers the social acceptance of formalization.\n\nThe transition from informal to formal working conditions is also complex, necessitating a redefinition of IWWs\u2019 roles.\n\nFinally, the formalization of IWWs plays a significant role in sustainable waste management. It requires a comprehensive approach that addresses social, financial, technical, and environmental dimensions.\n\nBy doing so, the transition from informal to formal waste management can be achieved, creating a brighter future for both IWWs and the communities they serve.","title":"Empowering Informal Waste Workers through Formalization","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/29/316236/","video":[]}
