Biden also congratulated Modi on India\u2019s recent moon landing.\n\nWhile India was disappointed that Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin declined to attend the G20, those absences could give Biden the space to further stitch together U.S. and India ties.\n\n\u201cThere are undeniable opportunities here for the United States,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe fully intend to strengthen and deepen our relationship. We leave it to China, in particular, to discuss and explain why they\u2019re not here.\u201d\n\nCampbell also suggested that a that a major infrastructure and communications project to connect India with the Middle East and Europe will be announced soon.\n\nBut when asked if Biden pushed Modi on press access and broader democratic issues in India, Campbell said Biden tries to be clear about issues critical to the health of democracy. Still, Campbell declined to get into specifics, saying the president \u201chas determined that he wants to conduct that dialogue in a dignified, respectful way.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. president received a Bollywood-style greeting after Air Force One landed, with dancers in flowing purple outfits gyrating to pop music.\n\nHaving feted Modi with a state visit to Washington in June, Biden is banking on the idea that successful diplomacy depends on personal connections. But it\u2019s a relationship largely being explored in private. White House reporters traveling with Biden were denied access to the leaders\u2019 meeting. Indian state media shared visuals of the meeting on social media.\n\nBiden and Modi have had more than a dozen in-person or virtual engagements since 2021 as both look to tighten the U.S.-India partnership amid shared major concerns. Those include an increasingly assertive China and monumental challenges posed by climate change, artificial intelligence, global supply chain resilience and other issues.\n\nModi has heavily branded the summit as his own. The prime minister has his image posted along the highway from the airport, greeting G20 delegates with quotes about climate change, innovation and India\u2019s unique role as an advocate for developing countries. As a result, Biden was something of a houseguest when he met his Indian counterpart.\n\nModi held the meeting at his residence, \u201cso it is unusual in that respect,\u201d White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Thursday aboard Air Force One.\n\nBiden, a center-left Democrat, and Modi, a conservative Hindu nationalist, are hardly ideological soulmates. Yet, both leaders are increasingly drawn together by China\u2019s military and economic maneuverings in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nIndia late last month lodged an objection through diplomatic channels with Beijing over China\u2019s new standard map that lays claim to India\u2019s territory along their shared border.\n\nThe version of the Chinese map published by the Ministry of Natural Resources website shows Arunachal Pradesh and the Doklam Plateau \u2014 over which the two sides have feuded \u2014 included within Chinese borders, along with Aksai Chin in the western section that China controls but India still claims. The Philippines and Malaysia have also lodged protests over the new Chinese map.\n\nThe map was released just days after Modi and Jinping met on the sidelines of a summit of the BRICS bloc of developing economies \u2014 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2014 and agreed to work to de-escalate tensions at their disputed border.\n\nThe administration was eager to build on the momentum from Modi\u2019s June state visit, which included announcements on climate, health care and space as well as some major private sector projects.\n\nThe two sides set the groundwork for U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India and the sale of U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones. U.S.-based Micron Technology agreed to build a $2.75 billion semiconductor assembly and test facility in India, with Micron spending more than $800 million and India financing the rest. The administration also plans to discuss civil nuclear issues.\n\nThe White House has sought to play down Biden and Modi \u2018s differences over Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. India abstained from voting on U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and refused to join the global coalition against Russia. Since the start of the war, the Modi government has dramatically increased its purchase of Russian oil.\n\nBiden\u2019s effort to pull India closer has been shadowed by concerns from activists and some American lawmakers about India\u2019s human rights record under Modi.\n\nThe prime minister has faced criticism over legislation amending the country\u2019s citizenship law that fast-tracks naturalization for some migrants but excludes Muslims, over a rise in violence against Muslims and other religious minorities by Hindu nationalists, and the recent conviction of India\u2019s top opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, for mocking Modi\u2019s surname.\n\nIndia also ranks 161st out of 180 countries in this year\u2019s Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders.","title":"Biden and Modi working in \u2018warmth and confidence\u2019 to build ties as Chinese leader skips G20","url":"http://en.setopati.com/International/161717","video":[]}
