We just simply divert traffic to other ports of entry,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nAfter the increased number of unauthorized crossings, Eagle Pass Mayor Rolando Salinas Jr. signed an emergency declaration.\n\nIn recent years, the region has become accustomed to regulating migration as it became a heavily used point for newcomers to cross into the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe emergency declaration grants us the ability to request financial resources to provide additional services caused by the influx of undocumented immigrants,\u201d Salinas wrote in Wednesday\u2019s emergency declaration.\n\n(VOA)","title":"Texas City sees jump in irregular migrant crossings","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/22/319328/","video":[]}
