Fear and anxiety about a new disease and what could happen can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children. Public health actions, such as social distancing, can make people feel isolated and lonely and can increase stress and anxiety. However, these actions are necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19.\n\nTaking care of your friends and your family can be a stress reliever, but it should be balanced with care for yourself. Helping others cope with their stress, such as by providing social support, can also make your community stronger. During times of increased social distancing, people can still maintain social connections and care for their mental health. Phone calls or video chats can help you and your loved ones feel socially connected, less lonely, or isolated.\n\nStress during COVID-19 outbreak can sometimes cause the following:\n\n\u2022 Fear and worry about your own health and the health of your loved ones, your financial situation or job, or loss of support services you rely on.\n\n\u2022 Changes in sleep or eating patterns.\n\n\u2022 Difficulty sleeping or concentrating.\n\n\u2022 Chronic health problems.\n\n\u2022 Worsening of mental health conditions. Increased use of tobacco, and alcohol\n\nSigns of Stress\n\nEveryone reacts to stress differently. However, some common signs and symptoms of the fight or flight response includes:\n\n\u2022 Frequent headaches.\n\n\u2022 Cold or sweaty hands and feet.\n\n\u2022 Frequent heartburn, stomach pain, or nausea.\n\n\u2022 Panic attacks.\n\n\u2022 Excessive sleeping or insomnia.\n\n\u2022 Persistent difficulty concentrating.\n\n\u2022 Obsessive or compulsive behaviors.\n\n\u2022 Social withdrawal or isolation.\n\n\u2022 Constant fatigue.\n\n\u2022 Irritability and angry episodes.\n\n\u2022 Significant weight gain or loss.\n\n\u2022 Consistent feelings of being overwhelmed or overloaded.\n\nSuicide\n\n\u2022 Different life experiences affect a person\u2019s risk for suicide. For example, suicide risk is higher among people who have experienced violence, including child abuse, bullying, or sexual violence. Feelings of isolation, depression, anxiety, and other emotional or financial stresses are known to raise the risk for suicide. People may be more likely to experience these feelings during a crisis like a pandemic.\n\n\u2022 However, there are ways to protect against suicidal thoughts and behaviors. For example, support from family and community, or feeling connected, and having access to in-person or virtual counseling or therapy can help with suicidal thoughts and behavior, particularly during a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nEffects of stress on depression\n\nWhile stress can generally have negative effects on your physical and mental health, it can be especially harmful if you have depression.\n\nStress can make you feel less able to maintain positive habits or coping strategies, which are important to managing depression. This can make symptoms of depression feel more intense. Interrupting a healthy routine can result in negative coping strategies, such as drinking or withdrawing from social relationships. These actions can result in further stress, which can then make depression symptoms worse.\n\nStress can also affect your mood, as anxiety and irritability are both common responses to stress. When a stressor causes you to feel anxious, the anxiety may result in more negative feelings or frustration, even if the stressor is only temporary.\n\nTips on managing stress\n\nStress management techniques are useful in coping with depression. Stress relief can also help prevent depressive symptoms from developing. Some helpful stress management techniques include:\n\n\u2022 getting enough sleep\n\n\u2022 eating a healthy diet\n\n\u2022 getting regular exercise\n\n\u2022 taking occasional vacations or regular breaks from work\n\n\u2022 finding a relaxing hobby, such as gardening or woodworking\n\n\u2022 consuming less caffeine or alcohol\n\n\u2022 doing breathing exercises to lower your heart rate\n\nIf lifestyle choices are causing you stress, you may consider changing the way you approach your personal or professional life. Some ways you can help decrease this kind of stress include:\n\n\u2022 putting yourself under less pressure to perform at work or school, such as by lowering your standards to a level you still find acceptable\n\n\u2022 not taking on as many responsibilities at work or activities at home\n\n\u2022 sharing responsibilities or delegating tasks to others around you\n\n\u2022 surrounding yourself with supportive and positive friends and family members\n\n\u2022 removing yourself from stressful environments or situations\n\nActivities such as yoga, meditation, or attending religious services can also help you deal with stress. A combination of these techniques may prove even more effective. It\u2019s important to find what works for you. And no matter what you choose, it\u2019s vital to have close friends and family members who are willing to support you.\n\nTalking to a counselor, therapist, or other mental health professional can also be a useful way to deal with stress and depression. Talk therapy alone or combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or medication is a proven solution for both depression and chronic stress. Medications for depression include:\n\n\u2022 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as citalopram (Celexa)\n\n\u2022 monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as isocarboxazid (Marplan)\n\n10 Simple Ways to De-stress during Covid\n\n1.
