Zelenskyy vowed stern retaliation for the attack, whose victims included a slain 6-year-old girl dead and 15 wounded children.\n\nAfter months of entreaties from Zelenskyy for F-16s to bolster the Ukrainian air force, the U.S. recently gave approval for the Netherlands and Denmark to provide Ukraine the American-made jets. Zelenskyy travelled to both countries Sunday to finalize the delivery deals.\n\n\u2019\u2019F-16s will certainly give new energy, confidence, and motivation to fighters and civilians. I\u2019m sure it will deliver new results for Ukraine and the entire Europe,\u2033 the Ukrainian leader said.\n\nUkraine hopes the jets will give it a combat edge, after launching a counteroffensive against the Kremlin\u2019s forces without air cover from Western aircraft, placing its troops at the mercy of Russian aviation and artillery.\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen pledged 19 F-16s to Ukraine and said she hoped the first six could be handed over around New Year. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte didn\u2019t provide a number or timeframe, saying it depends on how soon Ukrainian crews and infrastructure are ready. Zelenskyy said on his Telegram channel that Ukraine would get 42 jets.\n\n\u201cThe F-16s will not help immediately now with the war effort. It is anyway a long-term commitment from the Netherlands,\u201d Rutte said. \u201cWe want them to be active and operational as soon as possible. \u2026 Not for the next month, that\u2019s impossible, but hopefully soon afterward.\u201d\n\nHe and Zelenskyy inspected two gray F-16s parked in a hangar at a Dutch base in the southern city of Eindhoven.\n\nA few hours later, Zelenskyy and his wife were received by Frederiksen, other Danish Cabinet ministers and Crown Princess Mary at the Skrydstrup air base in southern Denmark where Ukrainian pilots will receive F-16 training in coming months. The two leaders climbed into a Danish F-16 and tried out the seats.\n\nFrederiksen said \u201chopefully\u201d six fighter jets could be delivered around New Year, eight more next year and the remaining five in 2025.\n\n\u201cPlease take this donation as a token of Denmark\u2019s unwavering support for your country\u2019s fight for freedom,\u201d she said.\n\nZelenskyy called the Dutch and Danish donations a \u201chuge push for other countries who were in doubt\u201d about providing Ukraine with F-16s. Asked whether there were conditions attached to the donations, such as a commitment not to use them in Russian territory, Zelenskyy said that had not been discussed but added that defending Ukrainian territory was the \u201cmain goal.\u201d\n\nThe Dutch and Danish governments are also spearheading a coalition that is working to train Ukrainian pilots to fly the advanced fighter jets.\n\nZelenskyy declined to say how many Ukrainian pilots would undergo training in Denmark and later in Romania, citing security reasons. Frederiksen said \u201cmore than 70\u201d Ukrainian personnel were already in Denmark and getting ready to start training.\n\nThe Danish Armed Forces said the Ukrainians must pass a security review and tests of their health and language skills before the training can begin.\n\n\u201cThe training is expected to last a minimum of six months. Exactly how long it will take to teach Ukrainians to operate the F-16 capability cannot be said precisely, as it will depend on their experience and language skills, among other things,\u201d the Danish Armed Forces said in a statement.\n\nOfficials have previously said that Ukrainian pilots will need six to eight months of training.\n\nSunday\u2019s announcements came two days after the Netherlands and Denmark said the U.S. had authorized them to deliver American-made F-16s to Ukraine in what was seen as a major boost for Kyiv.\n\nWashington says the F-16s \u2014 like the advanced U.S. Abrams tanks \u2014 will be crucial in the long term as Kyiv faces down Russia.\n\nDuring a visit to Sweden on Saturday, Zelenskyy also asked for Swedish Gripen fighter jets. Sweden has not decided on that request but has agreed to let Ukrainian pilots test the aircraft.\n\nUkraine has been relying on older aircraft, such as Russian-made MiG29 and Sukhoi jets. F-16s have newer technology and targeting capabilities. They are also more versatile, experts say.\n\nZelenskyy was set to address the Danish Parliament on Monday.\n\nIn Ukraine, the governor of the Chernihiv region, Vyacheslav Chaus, said Sunday that the number of people wounded in the theater attack Saturday had risen to 148.\n\n\u201cI am sure our soldiers will respond to Russia for this terrorist attack. Respond tangibly,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a video address published in the early hours of Sunday.\n\nIn eastern Ukraine, Kharkiv regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said Sunday that Russia was shelling the city of Kupiansk \u201call day long,\u201d with an attack in the city center wounding 11 people. A man was killed in Russian shelling of Vovchansk, also in the Kharkiv region, according to Ukraine\u2019s Internal Affairs Ministry.\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, the Defense Ministry said Sunday that its air defense systems had prevented an attack by three drones on the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine.\n\nRussian air defenses also jammed a drone flying towards Moscow early Sunday, causing it to crash. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry called it \u201can attempt by the Kyiv regime to carry out a terrorist attack.\u201d\n\nMoscow\u2019s Vnukovo and Domodedovo airports briefly suspended flights, but no victims or damage were reported.\n\nIn the city of Kursk, five people were wounded when a Ukrainian drone hit a train station, regional Gov. Roman Starovoit said. Kursk is the capital of the western region of the same name, which borders Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian authorities, who generally avoid commenting on attacks on Russian soil, didn\u2019t say whether Ukraine had any involvement.\n\nDrone strikes on the Russian border regions are a fairly regular occurrence. Attacks deeper inside Russian territory have been on the rise since a drone was destroyed over the Kremlin in early May. Successful strikes have exposed the vulnerabilities of Moscow\u2019s air defense systems.","title":"Denmark and Netherlands pledge to give F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine","url":"http://en.setopati.com/International/161606","video":[]}
