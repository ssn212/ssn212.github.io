Initially, he would convince his customers to take new credit cards and later facilitate the process of obtaining the cards for them,\u201d said a Delhi Police investigator, who didn\u2019t wish to be identified.\n\nOkheda allegedly took advantage of the card issuance process.\n\n\u201cHe would get hold of a customer\u2019s mobile phone during the card issuance process on some pretext. Then, he would secretly install a remote access app in the customer\u2019s mobile phone and return the device to him (the customer),\u201d said the investigator.\n\nAll that Okheda needed to carry out a fraudulent transaction was a one-time password (OTP) since he had the other credit card details of his victim.\n\nThe rule stipulates that an OTP must be sent to a customer\u2019s mobile phone number to validate a transaction.\n\nOkheda would use that app on his own mobile phone to gain remote access to the victim\u2019s mobile device and then steal the OTP.\n\nOkheda would delete the OTP from the victim\u2019s mobile phone after making a bogus transaction, the investigator said. Okheda would never leave behind any trail of evidence about his crime and the victim would be unaware that his mobile phone and privacy was breached to defraud him, he added.\n\nThe police have arrested the suspect following a six-month hunt.\n\nThe suspect\u2019s modus operandi was uncovered after he had gained illegal access to the mobile phone of an Indian Army personnel in the national capital and withdrew Rs 69,334 from the latter\u2019s credit card account, said Devender Arya, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) (south-west), Delhi Police.\n\nOkheda got busted after the Indian Army personnel approached the Delhi Cantonment police station authorities on March 9 after he had lost Rs 69,334 through a fraudulent transaction.\n\n\u201cThe Indian Army personnel found out that Rs 69,334 was withdrawn from his credit card even though he didn\u2019t share the card and OTP details with anyone,\u201d said DCP Arya.\n\nDelhi Police\u2019s cyber cell in the south-west district was assigned the case, and they approached the bank that had issued the credit card to the victim. \u201cThe bank authorities informed us that the money was transferred to two online payment apps and from there to a bank account registered in the name of Okheda. Some mobile phones registered in Okheda\u2019s name were also recharged using the duped money,\u201d said the DCP.\n\nOkheda had allegedly been changing his address repeatedly to evade arrest, the police said.\n\nFinally, acting on a tip-off, the police nabbed him from Baprola village in Dwarka on Wednesday.\n\nA probe is in progress to ascertain how many other credit card holders were allegedly cheated by Okheda, the police said.\n\n(With inputs from Hindustan Times)","title":"Nepali nat'l held for defrauding Army personnel of Rs 69,000 in India - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/12/126897/","video":[]}
