We have said in a very clear language that none of the guilty be spared and the innocent not implicated. We have issued standing order (sic) to the police to ensure that they work in a proper manner. The police have done their work,\u201d he has assured.\n\n\u201cThere is, therefore, no reason to suspect or be confused about this.
