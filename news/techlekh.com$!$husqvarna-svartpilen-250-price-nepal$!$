That\u2019s just the part of the good news, but the real good news is that the launch is happening sooner rather than later.\n\nHansraj Hulaschand & Co. Pvt. Ltd., the authorized distributors of KTM & Bajaj Bikes in Nepal, has confirmed the launch of Husqvarna in Nepal.\n\nWe\u2019ll get into all the nitty-gritty details, including the launch date and pricing, in a while. In the meantime, let\u2019s explore the two Husqvarna bikes in detail, before their inevitable launch in Nepal.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll put our focus on Husqvarna Svartpilen 250. Before we do that, the name is a mouthful and difficult. (Read about Husqvarna Vitpilen 250 here).\n\nHusqvarna is a Swedish name from a Swedish brand.\n\nSo, how\u2019s it pronounced? Husqvarna Svartpilen (pronounced as Huskvarna Swartpilen), meaning black arrow.\n\nWithout further due, let\u2019s get started!\n\nHusqvarna Svartpilen 250 Specifications Engine Type: Liquid Cooled, 4 Stroke, 4 Valve, DOHC\n\nLiquid Cooled, 4 Stroke, 4 Valve, DOHC Displacement: 248.8 cc\n\n248.8 cc Cooling System: Liquid Cooled\n\nLiquid Cooled Starting Mechanism: Self Starter Only\n\nSelf Starter Only Max Power: 30 PS @ 9000 rpm\n\n30 PS @ 9000 rpm Max Torque: 24 Nm @ 7500 rpm\n\n24 Nm @ 7500 rpm Gearbox: 6-Speed\n\n6-Speed Top Speed: 131.05 Kmph\n\n131.05 Kmph Fuel Tank Capacity: 9.5 liter\n\n9.5 liter Mileage: 25-30 kmpl\n\n25-30 kmpl Front Tyre: 110/70-R17 \u2013 Disc\n\n110/70-R17 \u2013 Disc Rear Tyre: 150/40-R17 \u2013 Disc\n\n150/40-R17 \u2013 Disc Tubeless Tyres: Yes\n\nYes Braking System: Dual-Channel ABS\n\nDual-Channel ABS Suspension Setup: WP USD Forks and WP Mono shock suspension\n\nWP USD Forks and WP Mono shock suspension Seat Height: 835 mm\n\n835 mm Ground Clearance: 145 mm\n\n145 mm Kerb Weight: 154 kg\n\n154 kg Colors: Black Husqvarna Svartpilen 250 Price in Nepal: below Rs. 6,00,000 (Expected)\n\nHusqvarna Svartpilen 250 Overview\n\nDesign\n\nHusqvarna Svartpilen 250 closely follows the design of its iconic 701 Supermoto model.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the difference?\n\nSvartpilen 250 is a scrambler, daunting a darker paint scheme, which goes well with the \u201cblack arrow\u201d its name.\n\nThe bike follows a minimalistic approach with a unibody feel. It does come off as a mix-match of a modern classic, where the shrunken rear pushes for a distinct style.\n\nAdditionally, it also gets a tank rack, 17-inch cast wheels, dual-purpose MRF tyres, split-seat, and a tall single-piece handlebar.\n\nHonestly, it is quite difficult to explain just how different the Husqvarna looks. Especially since it is the first time we see a design of this caliber brought to the mass market.\n\nALSO READ: TVS Apache RTR 160 4V Available in New Variant: Now More Affordable!\n\nPerformance\n\nHusqvarna Svartpilen 250 is powered by the same 248.8cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled, BS6-compliant FI engine. It can generate a max power of 30 PS at 9000rpm and max torque of 24Nm at 7500rpm.\n\nAdditionally, it is mated to a 6-speed gearbox with a fuel capacity of just 9.5-liters.\n\nWhile Husqvarna is an upcoming new brand, we\u2019ve already seen it perform in the Nepali territory.\n\nHusqvarna Svartpilen 250 is a KTM Duke 250 by heart. Being part of the same brand, there\u2019s a lot of parts sharing between the two motorcycles.\n\nFirstly, it is built on the Duke\u2019s Steel Trellis Frame chassis. Moreover, it also gets the same disc brakes, suspension setup, and back-lit switches.\n\nHusqvarna 250 will share the mechanical DNA with KTM 250, where the difference will be limited to visual feel.\n\nFeatures\n\nHusqvarna Svartpilen 250 comes with a good number of features. It shouldn\u2019t be a major surprise since it does fall under the premium segment.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick list of features in Husqvarna Svartpilen 250.\n\nHusqvarna Svartpilen 250 Feature Highlights\n\nSteel Trellis Frame for Superior Handling\n\nDual-Channel ABS\n\nDual-Disc BYBRE Brakes\n\nWP USD Front Suspension and WP Rear Mono Shock Suspension\n\nCircular All-Digital Instrument Cluster\n\nAll LED Lights\n\nTank Rack\n\nDual-Purpose MRF Tyres\n\nMinimalistic Darker Scrambler Design\n\nTaller-Single Piece Handle Bar\n\nUpright Riding Position\n\nHusqvarna Svartpilen 250 Price in Nepal and Availability\n\nAccording to reports, Husqvarna Svartpilen 250 is already here in Nepal. Moreover, KTM Nepal is in its final stages prepping up for the official launch.\n\nSo, when and how much?\n\nAs for the launch date, Husqvarna is set to debut in Nepal in the next 12-14 days. After this, the bikes will be available for purchase across all KTM showrooms.\n\nALSO READ: Bajaj Pulsar NS 160 ABS First Ride: Surprising Experience\n\nAgain, this might change due to the situation we are currently in, but let\u2019s hope for the best.\n\nAs for the pricing, Husqvarna Svartpilen 250 price in Nepal is expected to be below Rs. 6.00 Lakhs. If that\u2019s the case then, both Svartpilen and Vitpilen will share the same price range.\n\nMore interestingly, the price will get riders to access to 250cc BS6-compliant, at a far more accessible price range. Although, the design will play a major factor in the decision.\n\nFrankly, I am interested to see how the rider will react to it. The shorter tail section and 835mm seat-height cut out few points in practicality.\n\nHowever, people don\u2019t buy Husqvarna for the practicality, do they?\n\nI suggest we put our judgment to rest, at least until we see the new Husqvarna in the flesh.\n\nREAD NEXT: Jawa Motorcycle Launch in Nepal Confirmed!","title":"Husqvarna Svartpilen 250 Confirmed for Launch in Nepal","url":"http://techlekh.com/husqvarna-svartpilen-250-price-nepal/","video":[]}
