A righteous solution to the historical issues will be needed to move toward the future of genuine peace,\" Moon Ga-on, a college student, told Xinhua while attending the rally.\n\nSouth Korea unveiled a proposal in March to compensate South Korean victims of Japan's forced wartime labor through a government-backed foundation financed by private-sector donations, which triggered a strong backlash at home.\n\nForced labor victims and sex slavery victims, who were forced by Imperial Japan into sex servitude for military brothels during World War II, have demanded that the Japanese government sincerely apologize for its wartime atrocities.\n\nKishida told a joint press conference with Yoon that his cabinet will continue to inherit the positions of previous cabinets in terms of historical perception, saying his heart ached over people who suffered hard and sad things.\n\nHis remarks could be brutal to soothe the victims as most of the previous Japanese cabinets failed to acknowledge their responsibility and make a sincere apology for the wartime brutalities.\n\nKishida's remarks that his heart ached were an expression of his personal and direct feelings for the people, indicating that it was not an official apology from the Japanese government.\n\nWith regard to Japan's plan to discharge tritium-laced wastewater from its crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the Pacific this year, Oh Mi-jung, one of SPARK activists, told Xinhua that it would pollute the marine environment and threaten the lives and safety of people all over the world.\n\n\"Japan is a country that was devastated by atomic bombs in 1945 ... The plan to dump the radioactively contaminated water into the Pacific approved by the Japanese government, which is fully aware of nuclear and radioactive damages, will endanger the lives and safety of people around the world,\" the activist noted.\n\nAhead of Kishida's trip to Seoul, about 5,000 protesters held a candlelight rally in Seoul on Saturday night, opposing the Japanese prime minister's visit without an apology for historical issues.\n\nThey also called on Japan to abandon the tritium-laced water discharge plan, urging the South Korean government to stop its diplomacy obedient to Japan and the United States.","title":"South Koreans Protest Japanese PM's Visit to Seoul","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/27661/protest-visit-to-seoul-","video":[]}
