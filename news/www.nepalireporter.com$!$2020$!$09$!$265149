According to the Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA), among fresh deaths, 25 are in India, two in the Saudi Arabia and one in the South Africa. With this, the worldwide death toll of Nepali people from the virus has reached 189.\n\nIn a press statement issued from the UK this morning, the NRNA said that Nepali people residing in 38 countries in the world have been affected by the virus and most infections are in Maharashtra of India. Similarly, 35 Nepali who attended a family gathering in Luxembourg were infected once. Nepal government has failed to lobby for the safety, protection and compensation of the Nepalese living in the US, UK and other countries, not to mention those working in the Gulf. Writ cases are in the Nepalese courts asking the government for the protection of Nepalese abroad.\n\nSimilarly, the Nepalese Diaspora would want to know more about the origin, spread of the Corona virus. They would want to know about the progress in finding the vaccine such as from Russia and China. A viral news story has come out in www.allfakeornot.com claiming that some US servicemen were in Bangkok and testing the vaccine on Thai nationals.\n\nDuring the flood, these samples were washed away. There should either be confirmation or refute of such news. Nepalese Diaspora and NRNs would also want more pro-active Nepalese government foreign policy in order to help the Nepalese citizens stranded around the world amidst this crisis.","title":"\u2018189 Nepali People died due to CoronaVirus in outside Nepal\u2019","url":"http://www.nepalireporter.com/2020/09/265149","video":[]}
