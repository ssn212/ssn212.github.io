It\u2019s just 7.5mm thick and weighs only 160g. It has a plastic back with a matte finish. And, the rear camera module looks like the one from Apple iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nOn the front, it has a pill-shaped hole-punch design. The fingerprint is also underneath the screen and Oppo claims that it can unlock in 0.3 seconds. Oppo F17 Pro looks really slick and its design is really impressive.\n\nDisplay\n\nOppo F17 Pro flaunts a 6.43 inches Super AMOLED display with a screen resolution of 1080 x 2400px. Thin bezels and the hole-punch allows it to have an impressive 90.7% screen-to-body-ratio. Oppo claims a maximum brightness of 800 nits.\n\nIt\u2019s not a high fresh rate display though. It\u2019s a 60Hz refresh rate with a 180hz touch sampling rate but the phone is certified to play HD video from Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. Guarding the display and dual punch-hole cameras is Gorilla Glass 3+.\n\nHardware\n\nOppo F17 Pro is equipped with MediaTek Helio P95 chipset along with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage.\n\nMediaTek Helio P95 has a Octa-core (2\u00d72.2 GHz Cortex-A75 & 6\u00d72.0 GHz Cortex-A55) CPU and PowerVR GM9446 GPU. This is the same chipset used on the Oppo Reno 3 Pro. However, Oppo says that it has optimized the GPU for low-latency, lag-free rendering along with HDR imagery and sharp textures.\n\nALSO READ: Samsung M51 Officially Debuts with Massive 7000 mAh Battery\n\nHowever, P95 is an older chipset and the like of MediaTek Helio G90T/Snapdragon 720G have superior performance.\n\nCamera\n\nOppo F17 Pro has a quad-camera setup on the rear with an 8MP main camera (1/2\u201d sensor, f/1.8 lens), an 8MP ultrawide cam (1/4\u201d, f/2.2), plus two monochromatic 2MP sensors. The main sensor is Samsung\u2019s GM1ST 48MP sensor.\n\nOn the front, it has a 16MP IMX 471 main sensor and a 2MP depth sensor.\n\nIt can capture videos up to 4k 30fps videos from the rear camera and 1080p videos from the front camera.\n\nBattery\n\nOppo F17 Pro has a 4000 mAh battery along with 30W VOOC charging. 4000 mAh battery is not super impressive but its 30W charging can charge the device from 0 to 100 in around 60 mins.\n\nOppo has also provided a trickle charging feature which charges the phone overnight with battery optimizations designed to complete 100% charging at an AI determined morning wake time.\n\nOppo F17 Pro runs on Color OS 7.2 on top of Android 10.\n\nALSO READ: Oppo Mobiles Price in Nepal: Features and Specs\n\nOppo F17 Pro Price in Nepal and Availability\n\nOppo F17 Pro price in India is INR 23000 which is approx NPR 36,650. So, the Oppo F17 Pro price in Nepal could be around Rs. 43,000.\n\nOppo F17 Pro looks very stylish and cool. Its performance should be fine with the P95 but it should have used Helio G90T or Snapdarong 720/730. Also, many phones provide 64MP cameras at this price whereas it comes with a 48MP sensor.\n\nALSO READ: Best Mobiles Under Rs. 40,000 in Nepal: Features and Specs\n\nIt\u2019s looking like a good mid-range phone but it doesn\u2019t provide anything extra. It doesn\u2019t have a high refresh rate display nor does it have an exciting chipset.\n\nWhat do you think of the Oppo F17 Pro? Will it compete against the Redmi and Realme phones?\n\nAlso, watch our Vivo V19 review video!","title":"Oppo F17 Pro Launched: Looks Stylish and Cool, But Lacks Performance","url":"http://techlekh.com/oppo-f17-pro-price-nepal/","video":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/89YXyDuvD9E?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent"]}
