In this connection, the chief district officers of Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur have started consultations with the Ministry of health and Population and the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies along with the experts from various sectors, the people's representatives and the stakeholders.\n\n\"We have convened a virtual meeting among the Chief District Officer (CDO) of the three districts today only. Feedback from all the stakeholders has been taken and an appropriate decision would be made by forging a common viewpoint based on this,\" Kathmandu CDO Janak Raj Dahal said. A joint meeting of the CDOs of the three districts of the Valley on August 18 decided to enforce a week-long restriction throughout the three districts effective from 12 noon of August 20.\n\nThis restriction order has been extended till midnight tomorrow as per a decision of August 26. The CDOs have started the consultations to arrive at an appropriate decision regarding the prohibitory order a day before its expiry. He said that the three district administration offices of the Kathmandu valley would make a common understanding on form of prohibitory order prior to holding talks with the officials of the Home Ministry on Wednesday and due decision would be taken on the basis of the consultations.\n\nThe officials shared that some experts have offered suggestions to ease the lockdown while others have come for further stringent modality of the lockdown. However, the Valley Municipality Forum has asked for lockdown with further strict measures. Forum\u2019s Secretary Madan Sundar Shrestha said that they have recommended for strict measures as the caseload of the virus has further increased as shown by the latest result.\n\nLikewise, Mayor of Lalitpur Metropolitan City there is nothing better option than the prohibitory order if it is fully abided by the general public. Kathmandu Valley has started recording 100 to 500 COVID-19 cases every day. The coronavirus infection has started spreading in an expedited way from mid-August. Similarly, mortality rate is also found increased every day. Health experts said that making analysis that the restriction did not become effective would be premature in this situation.\n\nThe next week would be important as one type of result would come only after 14 days. Information Officer at the Home Ministry, Prem Lal Lamichhane, said that prohibitory order has now been imposed in 43 districts of the country. As per the Home Ministry\u2019s monitoring, the implementation of the restriction order was not satisfactory. He also drew attention of all that the situation might have been vulnerable if prohibitory order was not issued and local administration could take decision if it sees necessary.","title":"District authorities start discussions on modality of prohibitory order","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/15035","video":[]}
