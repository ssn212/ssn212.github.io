Russia has been accused of using them before.\n\nRussia has been trying to capture Bakhmut for months, despite its questionable strategic value. Western officials have estimated that thousands of Moscow's troops have died in the assault.\n\nWriting on Twitter, Ukraine's defence ministry said the phosphorus attack targeted \"unoccupied areas of Bakhmut with incendiary ammunition\".\n\nKyiv's special forces command added that Moscow's forces continued \"to destroy the city\".\n\nIt is unclear when exactly the alleged attack took place. But the footage shared by Ukraine - seemingly captured by a surveillance drone - showed high-rise buildings engulfed in flames.\n\nOther videos posted to social media showed fires raging on the ground.\n\nRussia has been accused of using white phosphorus several times since it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, including during the siege of Mariupol at the beginning of the war.\n\nWhite phosphorus is a wax-like substance which ignites on contact with oxygen, creating bright plumes of smoke.\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has warned the chemical is \"notorious for the severity of the injuries it causes\".\n\nIt burns at 800 degrees Celsius and can cause extreme burns on human flesh. It is also extremely sticky and hard to remove and can re-ignite when bandages are removed.\n\nRussia is a signatory to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which bans the use of incendiary weapons in civilian areas - that is, those designed to catch fire.\n\nBut HRW says white phosphorus does not fall under the treaty as its primary purpose is to \"create a smokescreen to hide military operations\".\n\nThe chemical has been used \"repeatedly over the past 15 years\", including by US forces against IS fighters in Iraq and Syria, according to HRW.\n\nSome analysts say its use as an incendiary weapon near civilians would still be illegal. While Bakhmut had a pre-war population of 80,000, there are practically no civilians left in the area.\n\nThe attack comes a day after the commander of Russia's Wagner paramilitary group said he would pull his forces out of Bakhmut on 10 May in a row over ammunition supplies.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin said Wagner's casualties were \"growing in geometrical progression every day\", and pinned his decision to withdraw from Bakhmut squarely on the defence ministry.\n\nDespite Prigozhin's claims, senior Ukrainian officials said Wagner was redeploying mercenaries towards Bakhmut in a bid to capture the city before Tuesday's Victory Day celebrations in Russia.\n\n\"We are now seeing them pulling [fighters] from the entire offensive line where the Wagner fighters were, they are pulling [them] to the Bakhmut direction,\" Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on Ukrainian television.\n\nThe intense fighting comes amid reports that Ukraine is preparing to launch a large-scale counteroffensive in the coming weeks. Prigozhin himself has said he believes the attack could come as soon as 15 May.\n\nAn offensive could take place in the Zaporizhzhia region which is about 80% controlled by Russia.\n\nOn Friday, the Russian-installed governor of the Zaporizhzhia region said he had ordered the evacuation of villages near the front line.\n\nRussia considers the area as its territory, following self-styled referendums and an illegal annexation last year.\n\n(BBC)","title":"Russia accused of using phosphorus bombs in Bakhmut","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/27652/accused-of-using-phosphorus-bombs-","video":[]}
