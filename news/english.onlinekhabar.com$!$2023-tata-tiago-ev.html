Photo: Tata Motors Nepal\n\nThe Tata Tiago EV is predicted to take the Nepali electric vehicle market by storm. Tata Motors Nepal say there have been over 500 bookings of the electric hatchback after the 2023 NADA Auto Show.\n\nThe Tiago EV is the electric version of the much popular Tata Tiago hatchback. The Tiago is famous for its small size, price and features in both Nepal and India. Like its petrol version, the Tiago EV has quickly gained a lot of attention for the various options it has and the price.\n\nThe electric hatchback was introduced in India on September 28, 2022, and a year later, it arrived in Nepal, where a handful of them are already visible on the roads.\n\nLet us see what the electric hatchback offers.\n\nSpecifications of Tata Tiago EV\n\nDimensions Length: 3,769mm\n\nWidth: 1,677 mm\n\nHeight: 1,536 mm Wheelbase 2,400 mm Ground clearance 166 mm Boot Space without Parcel Shelf\n\n240 litres Variants Mid-range\n\nXE\n\nXT\n\n\n\nLong range\n\nXT\n\nXZ+\n\nXZ+ Tech Lux Motor type Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSN) Electric Motor Power Mid-range: 45 kW\n\nLong-range: 49.01 kW Electric Motor Torque Mid-range: 110 Nm\n\nLong-range: 114 Nm Battery pack Mid-range: 19.2 kWh\n\nLong-range: 24 kWh Range Mid-range: 250 km\n\nLong-range: 315 km IP rating for motor and battery IP67 Acceleration (0-60km/h) Mid-range: 6.2 sec\n\nLong-range: 5.7 sec Transmission All variants: Fully Automatic Drive Charging Using a 3.3 kW charger: 6.9 hours for Mid-range variants\n\n8.7 hours for Long-range variants\n\nUsing a 7.7 kW charger: 2.6 hours for Mid-range variants\n\n3.6 hours for Long-range variants Brakes All variants\n\nFront: Disc\n\nRear: Drum Suspension All variants\n\nFront: Independent Lower Wishbone McPherson Dual Path (Strut Type)\n\nRear: Rear Twist Beam With Coil Spring Mounted on Hydraulic Shock Absorbers Tyre size 175/65 R14 Colours Signature Teal Blue\n\nTropical Mist\n\nDaytona Grey\n\nMidnight Plum\n\nPristine White Price Mid-range\n\nXE: Rs 21,99,000\n\nXT: Rs 22,99,000\n\n\n\nLong-range\n\nXT: Rs 25,49,000\n\nXZ+: Rs 26,99,000\n\nXZ+ Tech LUX: Rs 27,99,000\n\nDesign\n\nExterior\n\nThe Tata Tiago shares the same design as its petrol brother, the Tata Tiago with some changes. Instead of a large grille for air intake, it has a closed honeycomb-designed grill which reduces the airflow inside the car for better performance and range. The headlights are projector LED with DRLs. The chrome finishes in the Tiago are now blue indicating it is an EV.\n\nPhoto: Tata Motors Nepal\n\nThe side of the Tiago EV is streamlined with EV badging. It is equipped with tires sized at 175/65 R14 on both the front and the back. The EV has five variants and all differ in features both externally and internally. In the XE and XT models, there is a clean and cohesive design with body-coloured outer door handles, projector headlamps, DRLs, ORVMs with side indicators, full-wheel covers, and body-coloured bumpers, providing a sleek and modern look.\n\nPhoto: Tata Motors Nepal\n\nStepping up to the XT LR, you get the addition of a contrasting black roof, elevating the aesthetic appeal. Moving further, the XZ+ LR and XZ+ Tech LUX LR variants introduce even more sophistication with enhancements like a piano black strip on the door handles, front fog lamps, fog bezel with piano black accents, and distinct EV accents on the Humanity Line. The XZ+ LR and XZ+ Tech LUX LR also boast a contrast black roof and some EV accents.\n\nPhoto: Tata Motors Nepal\n\nThe Tata Tiago EV\u2019s rear is simple with a full-width LED tail lamp cluster and EV-specific reflectors for improved night visibility. A sporty touch is added with a black faux skid plate, while a redesigned rear bumper enhances aerodynamics and reduces drag through a prominent diffuser. It also has a rear camera and rear wiper for better visibility on what is going back.\n\nPhoto: Tata Motors Nepal\n\nInterior\n\nThe interior of the Tata Tiago EV is modern. The front dash of the Tata Tiago EV features a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system at the centre. Just above the infotainment system, there are two air vents and a climate control panel below the infotainment system, it also houses essential controls like power window switches, gear selectors, and hazard light switches. The 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system offers features like Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Bluetooth connectivity, and a USB port. The climate control panel is easy to use for adjusting air conditioning settings. However, the base model XE does not get an infotainment system.\n\nPhoto: Tata Motors Nepal\n\nThe seats in the Tiago EV are comfortable and supportive. The front seats are spacious, providing ample legroom and headroom. The back seats, though comfortable, might be a bit cramped for taller passengers. The seats are leather in the top model XZ+ Tech Lux whereas the other four get fabric-upholstered.\n\nPhoto: Tata Motors Nepal\n\nThe driver\u2019s seat can be adjusted for height and tilt, while the passenger seat can be adjusted for position. The back seats can seat three people with some adjustment but can fit two adults with ease. The back seats can be folded down to increase boot space. The Tiago EV offers 242 litres of boot space, which is sufficient for most needs.\n\nPhoto: Tata Motors Nepal\n\nThe steering wheel is wrapped in leather in the top variant. It has different buttons to control things like audio for music and sound, cruise control and call options. The digital instrument cluster is available in all the variants and displays information such as such as speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, and battery gauge. It is customisable, allowing the driver to choose the information they want to see.\n\nPhoto: Tata Motors Nepal\n\nThe centre console is simple with a small compartment and a gear know. The gear and mode switches in the Tata Tiago EV\u2019s centre console are user-friendly and well-designed. To choose a gear, you simply turn the easy-to-use rotary knob and select your driving mode; Eco or Sport.\n\nPhoto: Tata Motors Nepal\n\nPerformance\n\nThe Tata Tiago EV runs on an electric motor known as a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSN). This motor comes in two power options: 45 kW for mid-range and 49.01 kW for long-range, giving the car the ability to accelerate swiftly.\n\nPhoto: Tata Motors Nepal\n\nTo power the electric motor, the Tiago EV uses a battery pack of 19.2 kWh for the mid-range and 24 kWh for the long-range. This enables the car to travel a good distance on a single charge \u2013 250 km for mid-range and 315 km for long-range, providing an efficient ride.\n\nTata Tiago EV.

In terms of acceleration, the mid-range variant can accelerate from 0 to 60 km/h in 6.2 seconds, while the long-range variant in just 5.7 seconds.\n\nCharging the Tiago EV is convenient. Using a 3.3 kW charger, it takes 6.9 hours for mid-range variants and 8.7 hours for long-range variants to fully charge. With a more powerful 7.7 kW charger, this time is significantly reduced to 2.6 hours for mid-range and 3.6 hours for long-range variants.\n\nPhoto: Tata Motors Nepal\n\nThe brakes in all variants are equipped with front disc and rear drum brakes. The suspension in all variants for the front is an Independent Lower Wishbone McPherson Dual Path and the rear is a Rear Twist Beam With Coil Spring Mounted on Hydraulic Shock Absorbers.\n\nSafety and features\n\nThe Tata Tiago EV prioritizes safety with a range of essential features. Inside, dual airbags are in place to protect both the driver and the passenger. Additionally, the Tiago EV is equipped with ABS and EBD, preventing wheel lockup. Hill Hold Assist ensures the vehicle remains stationary on an incline during the start, minimizing the risk of rolling backwards.\n\nPhoto: Tata Motors Nepal\n\nFurthermore, the inclusion of reverse parking sensors aids the driver in detecting obstacles when reversing. The Tiago EV also incorporates a speed alert system, reminding the driver to adhere to speed limits and a seatbelt reminder for all passengers.\n\nPhoto: Tata Motors Nepal\n\nIn addition to these safety features, the Tiago EV has other technical safety features such as an intelligent tire pressure monitoring system (iTPMS) that constantly monitors tire pressure. Child-safety rear door locks prevent unauthorised door opening from the inside.\n\nIt is equipped with Impact sensing and auto-door unlock, which automatically unlocks the doors to facilitate a swift exit in the event of a collision. Lastly, a puncture repair kit is included, offering a convenient solution to repair punctured tires without the need for a tire change, ensuring a smooth and safe journey. However, all the safety features might not be available in all the variants and differ accordingly.\n\nPhoto: Tata Motors Nepal\n\nSome of the key features of the Tata Tiago EV are as follows:\n\nClosed-off grille with tri-arrow pattern\n\nProjector headlamps with blue LED DRLs\n\nFog lamps\n\nEV-specific alloy wheels\n\nContrast black roof (optional)\n\n7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay\n\nMulti-utility steering wheel with cruise control buttons\n\nAutomatic climate control\n\nDigital instrument cluster\n\nPuncture repair kit\n\nDual airbags for driver and passenger\n\nABS with EBD\n\nHill Hold Assist\n\nReverse parking sensors\n\n8-hour standard AC charging\n\n50-minute fast DC charging\n\nThe Tata Tiago EV is available in five different colour options; Signature Teal Blue, Tropical Mist, Daytona Grey, Midnight Plum and Pristine White.\n\nTata Tiago EV colour options.
