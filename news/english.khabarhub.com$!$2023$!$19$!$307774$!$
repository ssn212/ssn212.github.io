So, I think there is a very compelling case for stronger and stronger India-U.S. relations,\u201d Jaishankar told reporters last week.\n\nThe most compelling case, analysts say, is the rise of China. Modi visits the United States as India\u2019s fraying ties with Beijing following a three-year-long military standoff along their disputed Himalayan borders have prompted New Delhi to drop previous hesitations and work closely with Washington in Asia as it seeks to counterbalance an increasingly assertive Beijing.\n\n\u201cThe strategic landscape in the Indo-Pacific has changed very dramatically and there is recognition both in Washington and New Delhi that they need to work ever so closely to stabilize the situation,\u201d said Harsh Pant, vice president, studies and foreign policy, at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi.\n\n\u201cThat strategic clarity has meant that for India strengthening ties with a like-minded country like the U.S. has become a strategic imperative,\u201d he said.\n\nGiving India access to advanced defense technologies, including coproduction of weapons, is expected to be a key takeaway during Modi\u2019s visit. This could include an agreement to produce jet engines by General Electric for military aircraft in India according to a Reuters report. The two countries are also discussing the possible purchase of U.S.-made armed drones by India.\n\nAnalysts say the defense partnership is being shored up as Washington wants to build India\u2019s military capabilities.\n\n\u201cThe Americans are looking to strengthen India as a counterweight to China, so they want to support India\u2019s military modernization,\u201d according to Sreeram Chaulia, dean of the Jindal School of International Affairs. \u201cThat is why both sides have removed some of the cobwebs that existed and are saying we have the same adversary, and we need to cooperate a lot more to push back this shared adversary.\u201d\n\nHe said that from India\u2019s standpoint also there are question marks over the viability of Russia as a military supplier, which for decades provided the bulk of Indian military hardware, to provide India with advanced weapons as it is weakened by Western sanctions.\n\nThe groundwork for Modi\u2019s visit has been laid by recent high-level visits by U.S. officials to India. Earlier this month, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the two countries are setting a roadmap for defense industrial cooperation.\n\nModi is also expected to meet top business leaders in Washington as he tries to woo American companies amid U.S. efforts to diversify supply chains beyond China in critical areas such as semiconductors.\n\nBuilding factories in India however has not been easy with U.S. businesses often complaining of regulatory and bureaucratic hurdles.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, on a visit to New Delhi, told an Indian business forum Tuesday that both countries are engaged in efforts to facilitate trade.\n\n\u201cA number of the deliverables at that [Modi] visit are not just bullet points on a page. They are fundamentally designed to remove those obstacles in defense trade, in high-tech trade, in investment in each of our countries in taking away obstacles,\u201d according to Sullivan.\n\nThe areas in which the two countries aim to deepen cooperation include quantum computing, artificial intelligence and 5G wireless networks \u2014 areas in which China has acquired a dominating position.\n\nThe visit will include all the pomp and ceremony that accompanies state visits \u2013 the last state visit by an Indian prime minister to Washington took place in 2009. Modi will also address a joint session of the U.S. Congress \u2013 the second time he will be doing it since he took power nine years ago.\n\nIn Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, addressing the U.S.-India Business Council on Monday, expressed optimism about the visit.\n\n\u201cSo, we are here almost literally on the eve of what we believe will be a historic state visit by Prime Minister Modi, one that will further solidify what President Biden has called the defining relationship of the 21st century.\u201d\n\nHowever, amid shifting geopolitics, the two countries are not always on the same page. India has strongly defended maintaining friendly ties with Russia in the aftermath of its Ukraine aggression. In recent months, Moscow has become New Delhi\u2019s biggest crude oil supplier as India snaps up supplies of cheap energy.\n\nCritics have also expressed concerns about democratic backsliding in India, accusing the Modi administration of stifling dissent and divisive policies that discriminate against Muslims and other minorities. In its latest annual report on human rights practices, the U.S. State Department also highlighted challenges to freedom of expression and violence targeting religious and ethnic minorities in India. New Delhi rejected the report calling it flawed and biased.\n\nBut analysts say the effort by both countries during Modi\u2019s visit will be to build on common interests while managing their differences as the two countries focus on the big picture of countering China.\n\n\u201cWhen the Ukraine war started there was a lot of concern that it will derail the relationship and the two countries are going in different directions,\u201d Pant said.\n\n\u201cBut the relationship has continued to grow, it fact it has become more vibrant. I think that is because there is a new recognition that with all the challenges that India faces, it is a good bet and Washington needs to cultivate India,\u201d he said.\n\n(VOA)","title":"Geopolitics seen as driving close Indo-US ties during Modi US visit","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/19/307774/","video":[]}
