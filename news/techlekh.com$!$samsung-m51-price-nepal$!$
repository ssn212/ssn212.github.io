It has the same design from the back with the change in fingerprint sensor placement. It\u2019s now side-mounted instead of rear-mounted. It has a similar plastic back and plastic frame with a glossy finish.\n\nOn the front, it now has a hole-punch on the center just like the A51 and A71.\n\nALSO READ: Samsung Mobiles Price in Nepal: Features and Specs\n\nDisplay\n\nM51 is rocking a 6.7-inch Infinity-O display with Super AMOLED Plus technology. The display size is the same as that of A71, so it could be the same panel as well.\n\nIt\u2019s an FHD Super AMOLED panel with a screen resolution of 1080 X 2340. It is protected by Gorilla Glass 3 as well.\n\nHardware\n\nSamsung has been using Exynos chipsets on it\u2019s M-series phones but the M51 uses Snapdragon 730 chipset. It\u2019s the same chipset used on the Samsung Galaxy A71.\n\nSnapdragon 730 has an Octa-core (2\u00d72.2 GHz Kryo 470 Gold & 6\u00d71.8 GHz Kryo 470 Silver) CPU and Adreno 618 GPU. It will be able to run high-end games at high settings. This is definitely a much-needed change that I would love to see more of in the future.\n\nAlong with this, it comes with 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage.\n\nCamera\n\nSamsung Galaxy M51 has a quad-camera setup with a 64MP main sensor, a 12MP ultra wide-angle sensor, a 5MP macro sensor, and a 5MP depth sensor. Whereas, it comes with a 32MP sensor on the front.\n\nHere, the main 64MP sensor is Sony\u2019s IMX 682 sensor. It\u2019s the same sensor used on the Samsung M31s. It can capture videos up to 4K 30fps from the rear camera and up to 1080p 30fps from the front.\n\nBattery\n\nSamsung M51 has a humongous 7000 mAh battery along with a 25W fast charging. This battery could practically last for 2 days under general usage.\n\nSamsung has been providing huge batteries on its M series phones and M51 takes it a notch higher.\n\nFurthermore, it runs on One UI 2.0 on top of Android 10.\n\nSamsung M51 Price in Nepal and Availability\n\nSamsung M51 has only been launched in some parts of Europe for 360 euros. It is rumored to launch in India in the 2nd week of September with an expected price of INR 30,000. Given, Samsung Nepal\u2019s previous track record, the Samsung M51 price in Nepal could be around Rs. 49,000.\n\nSamsung M51 looks really impressive on paper. Samsung has finally ditched its Exynos 9611 and has equipped the M51 with Snapdragon 730.\n\nSamsung has also outdone itself in the battery department with the 7000 mAh battery. It has a good camera sensor as well and looks pretty solid overall.\n\nWith its price tag, it will be going up against the likes of Mi Note 10 Lite and OnePlus Nord.\n\nAlso, watch our Samsung Note 20 Ultra first look video!","title":"Samsung M51 Officially Debuts with Massive 7000 mAh Battery","url":"http://techlekh.com/samsung-m51-price-nepal/","video":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/oX4AZgHl2EE?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent"]}
