Now they need to stay in quarantine or isolation only for 10 days.\n\nAssociate Spokesperson at the Ministry of Health, Dr Samir Kumar Adhikari said the period of stay in quarantine or isolation has been reduced after various studies showed that the infection is not transmitted from one person to another after 10 days.\n\nThe Policy, Planning and Monitoring Division at the Ministry had decided that all the infected persons except those fallen sick after showing symptoms of infection and seriously ill people would be kept in quarantine or isolation only for 10 days.\n\nSimilarly, the Health Emergency Operation Centre has said those people coming from foreign countries have to mandatorily stay in quarantine or isolation for 10 days.
