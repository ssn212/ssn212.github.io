First launched back in 2003, the motorbike quickly gained a lot of attraction and was a favourite among many.\n\nThe bike also had a big fanbase here in Nepal too. But sadly, it was discontinued in 2017. Despite that, it was still a choice of many people. Fast forward to 2023, Hero MotorCorp, after six long years, has brought the Karizma XRM back with a bold and new look and a ton of new features.\n\nThe new gen XMR has garnered a lot of positive reviews for the design and the features it provides.
