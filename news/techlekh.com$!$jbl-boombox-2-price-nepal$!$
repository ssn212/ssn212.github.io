And, one of its specializations is portable speakers. Among them, JBL Boombox is a series of portable, ultra-loud, and rugged speakers.\n\nJBL launched the JBL Boombox 2 recently and EvoStore is set to launch JBL Boombox 2 in Nepal very soon.\n\nJBL Boombox is one of those speakers that can handle just about everything as it is durable, waterproof, and comes with an all-day battery.

It is big and heavy but it is portable as it gets a handle to easily carry it fro one place to another.\n\nIt comes with an IPX7 rating meaning it can be submerged up to 3.3 feet underwater for up to 30 minutes.\n\nIt looks similar to the JBL BoomBox. There\u2019s a huge handle on top of the speaker and the housing is covered in the grille. On the front, there are buttons for power, Bluetooth, play/pause, and volume control.\n\nIt also has a dedicated party boost button for linking the speaker with other JBL speakers to output the same audio. Then it has a LED strip on the front face which works as a battery indicator.\n\nOn the back, it has a panel for a power supply, a USB charging port, a micro USB port, and a 3.5mm aux input.\n\nConnectivity and Audio\n\nJBL BoomBox 2 comes with the loudest and most massive JBL Signature Pro Sound. It pumps out powerful and deep bass thanks to the two large passive radiators that aid in pumping out the bass. There are two 30-watt tweeters and two 40-watt woofers that operate in a combined frequency range of 50Hz to 20KHz.\n\nALSO READ: JBL Tune 220TWS with 19 Hours Playback to Launch Soon in Nepal\n\nIt is compatible with Bluetooth 5.1 but it only supports the SBC Bluetooth codec. It does not support AAC or AptX codec.\n\nBattery\n\nJBL BoomBox 2 has a monstrous 10,000 mAh which JBL claims can provide up to 24 hours of continuous music playback. It can also be used as a power bank to charge devices like smartphones.\n\nAs for charging, it takes 6.5 hours to charge it from 0 to 100.\n\nJBL BoomBox 2 Price in Nepal and Availability\n\nJBL BoomBox 2 price in Nepal will be around Rs. 65,000. It is available in black and a camo version. It will be available soon via EvoStore.\n\nJBL BoomBox 2 is one of those audio speakers which is for the ones that one to flex and party hard.\n\nHowever, I find it confusing to know that a 500$ speaker doesn\u2019t support AAC or AptX codec. Also, there\u2019s no companion app so EQ adjustments can not be made.\n\nREAD NEXT: Redmi SonicBass Wireless Earphones Launched in Nepal, Priced at Rs. 2,099\n\nAlso, watch our Accurate AT-01 TWS Review in Nepali.","title":"JBL BoomBox 2 with a Monstrous 10,000 mAh Battery Set to Launch in Nepal","url":"http://techlekh.com/jbl-boombox-2-price-nepal/","video":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/QEnedsSnc_M?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent"]}
