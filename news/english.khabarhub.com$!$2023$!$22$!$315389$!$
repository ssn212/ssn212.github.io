The Ministry\u2019s latest call to get the Chinese people involved in anti-spying work follows an expansion of China\u2019s counter-espionage law that took effect in July 2023.\n\nChina\u2019s declaration that it is under threat from spies comes as Western nations, most prominently the US, accuse China of espionage and cyberattacks, a charge that Beijing has rejected.\n\nThe law, which bans the transfer of information related to national security and interests which it does not specify, has alarmed the United States, saying foreign companies in China could be punished for regular business activities.\n\nThe revised law allows authorities carrying out an anti-espionage probe to gain access to data, electronic equipment, and information on personal property.\n\nUS State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said, \u201cCertainly encouraging citizens to spy on each other is something that\u2019s of great concern.\u201d\n\nChinese lawmakers passed a wide-ranging update to Beijing\u2019s antiespionage legislation on Wednesday, banning the transfer of any information related to national security and broadening the definition of spying.\n\nChina\u2019s top legislative body had passed (25 April 2023) the revised counter-espionage law\u2019s first update since 2014, after three days of deliberations.\n\nThe revised Chinese counter-espionage law provides the basis for China to arrest and detain dozens of Chinese and foreign nationals on suspicion of espionage, including most recently, an executive at Japanese drugmaker Astellas Pharma in March 2023.\n\nCheng Lei, Australian journalist, accused by China for providing state secrets to another country, has been in detention since September 2020.\n\nChina\u2019s declaration that it is under threat from spies comes as Western nations, most prominently the US, accuse China of espionage and cyberattacks, a charge that Beijing has rejected.\n\nThe US itself is the \u201cempire of hacking,\u201d a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson has claimed.\n\n(Source: Various news agencies/outlets)","title":"China asks its people to spy for the CPC","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/22/315389/","video":[]}
