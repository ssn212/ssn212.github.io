Some smaller studies previously suggested that antibodies may disappear quickly and that some people with few or no symptoms may not make many at all.\n\nThe new study was done by Reykjavik-based deCODE Genetics, a subsidiary of the U.S. biotech company Amgen, with several hospitals, universities and health officials in Iceland. The country tested 15% of its population since late February, when its first COVID-19 cases were detected, giving a solid base for comparisons.\n\nScientists used two different types of coronavirus testing: the kind from nose swabs or other samples that detects bits of the virus, indicating infection, and tests that measure antibodies in the blood, which can show whether someone was infected now or in the past.\n\nBlood samples were analyzed from 30,576 people using various methods, and someone was counted as a case if at least two of the antibody tests were positive. These included a range of people, from those without symptoms to people hospitalized with signs of COVID-19.\n\nIn a subgroup who tested positive, further testing found that antibodies rose for two months after their infection initially was diagnosed and then plateaued and remained stable for four months.\n\nPrevious studies suggesting antibodies faded quickly may have been just looking at the first wave of antibodies the immune system makes in response to infection; those studies mostly looked 28 days after diagnosis. A second wave of antibodies forms after a month or two into infection, and this seems more stable and long-lasting, the researchers report.\n\nThe results don\u2019t necessarily mean that all countries\u2019 populations will be the same, or that every person has this sort of response. Other scientists recently documented at least two cases where people seem to have been reinfected with the coronavirus months after their first bout.\n\nThe new study does not establish how much or which type of antibody confers immunity or protection \u2014 that remains unknown.\n\nThe study also found:\n\n\u2014 Testing through the bits-of-virus method that\u2019s commonly done in community settings missed nearly half of people who were found to have had the virus by blood antibody testing. That means the blood tests are far more reliable and better for tracking spread of the disease in a region and for guiding decisions and returning to work or school, researchers say.\n\n\u2014 Nearly a third of infections were in people who reported no symptoms.\n\n\u2014 Nearly 1% of Iceland\u2019s population was infected in this first wave of the pandemic, meaning the other 99% are still vulnerable to the virus.\n\n\u2014 The infection fatality rate was 0.3%. That\u2019s about three times the fatality rate of seasonal flu and in keeping with some other more recent estimates, said Dr. Derek Angus, critical care chief at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.\n\nAlthough many studies have been reporting death rates based on specific groups such as hospitalized patients, the rate of death among all infected with the coronavirus has been unknown.\n\nThe news that natural antibodies don\u2019t quickly disappear \u201cwill be encouraging for people working on vaccines,\u201d Angus said.","title":"Large antibody study offers hope for virus vaccine efforts","url":"http://en.setopati.com/social/153807","video":[]}
