With India, we did that many weeks ago. We are there to work constructively with India and we hope that they engage with us so that we can get to the bottom of this very serious matter.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Trudeau alleged India\u2019s role behind the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar resulting in flaring up of tensions between the two nations.\n\nIndia on Tuesday rejected such allegations calling them \u2018absurd\u2019 and \u2018motivated\u2019. Ministry of External Affairs in a press release said that Canadian PM Justin Trudeau had made similar allegations to PM Narendra Modi and they were \u201ccompletely rejected.\u201d\n\nMEA in a press release said, \u201cWe have seen and reject the statement of the Canadian Prime Minister in their Parliament, as also the statement by their Foreign Minister. Allegations of the Government of India\u2019s involvement in any act of violence in Canada are absurd and motivated.\u201d\n\nIt further said, \u201cSimilar allegations were made by the Canadian Prime Minister to our Prime Minister, and were completely rejected.\u201d India on Tuesday expelled a senior Canadian diplomat in a reciprocal move to Canada expelling a senior Indian diplomat in light of the claim of New Delhi\u2019s involvement in the killing of the wanted separatist leader.\n\nOn Thursday, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said that the allegations made by Canada regarding the \u201cpotential links\u201d of India behind the killing of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar are \u201cpolitically driven\u201d.\n\n\u201cYes, I do think there is a degree of prejudice here. They have made allegations and taken action against them. To us, it seems that these allegations by the government of Canada are primarily politically driven,\u201d Bagchi said while addressing a weekly presser.\n\nThe MEA spokesperson further said no information has been shared by Canada regarding the killing of Nijjar.\n\n\u201cWe are willing to look at any specific information that is provided to us, but so far we have received no specific information from Canada,\u201d Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said answering queries.\n\n(ANI)","title":"Shared credible allegations with India weeks ago: Canada PM Trudeau","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/23/319445/","video":[]}
