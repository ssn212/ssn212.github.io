He has not seen any other crew members since then, Higashi said.\n\nThe 11,947-ton Gulf Livestock 1 ship was carrying 5,800 cows west of Amami Oshima in the East China Sea when it sent a distress call early Wednesday. The weather was rough in the area due to Typhoon Maysak.\n\nThe typhoon has since passed the area and the weather during the search is fine, Higashi said.\n\nThe ship\u2019s other crew members include 38 others from the Philippines, two from New Zealand and two from Australia.\n\nThe ship left the port of Napier in northeastern New Zealand in mid-August and was on its way to Tangshan on China\u2019s eastern coast.\n\nIts automatic identification system tracker gave its last position nearly two days ago, according to the ship-tracking website MarineTraffic.com. Based on that position, it was sailing in high winds of 58 knots (66 miles or 107 kilometers per hour), MarineTraffic.com said.\n\nThe ship\u2019s operator, Gulf Navigation Holdings PJSC, based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, declined to comment. The company, traded on the Dubai Financial Market, says it owns and operates chemical tankers, livestock vessels and other ships.","title":"Livestock ship carrying 42 crew sinks off Japan's coast","url":"http://en.setopati.com/social/153829","video":[]}
