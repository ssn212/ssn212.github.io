Oli finally pledged to withdraw the ordinance in the standing committee meeting the next day but it was later revealed after he dissolved the House on December 20 that the Constitutional Council meeting on December 15 evening had recommended to fill all the vacant constitutional positions as per the provisions of the ordinance.\n\n\"The government should bring ordinance when it faces difficulty when the House session is not on. Not convening House session for six months and bringing an ordinance to foment trouble is wrong,\" Bidari told Setopati about his rejection motion. \"The Constitutional Council should recommend appointment of top officials at the constitutional bodies. There is a constitutional provision for that. I have registered the rejection motion as lowering requirement for quorum of such important meeting is not right.\"\n\nThe ordinances issued by the government should be presented to both the Houses and would be automatically revoked if not endorsed by both the Houses within 60 days of the start of House session.","title":"National Assembly member Bidari registers motion to reject Constitutional Council ordinance","url":"http://en.setopati.com/political/154791","video":[]}
