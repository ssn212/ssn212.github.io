However, some people had narrowly escaped the death trap. As some of the bodies were found in parts it was difficult to identify the deceased, said Police Inspector Prakash Singh Bhandari, who was involved in the search operations. The landslide had swept away 40 households. Most of the houses are beyond recognition. The rivulet is flowing through the human settlement.","title":"Dhorpatan landslide: Four deceased identified","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/15076","video":[]}
