The tea growers of Suryodaya municipality are agitated citing they were not getting even the minimum price determined by the local government. They have formed a struggle committee and are mulling waging a protest movement. The tea farmers met with the Assistant Chief District Officer, Mohan Neupane, on Monday and handed him a memorandum, urging the district administration to have the agreements reached before implemented.\n\nThe Suryodaya Municipality had fixed the minimum price of tea produced by the farmers at Rs 40 per kilogramme last year before this, following consultations with the tea entrepreneurs and the farmers. Tea Farmers Struggle Committee coordinator Sonam Chhiring Kaji (Gyani) said they are compelled to go for strike as the entrepreneurs have told farmers that they would be paying only Rs 20 to Rs 30 per kilogramme.\n\nIt is said the cost of production of the farmers is Rs 37.5 per kilogramme. Kaji said the price the entrepreneurs were offering them, Rs 20 per kilogramme, is peanuts and the farmers would be at loss at this price.
