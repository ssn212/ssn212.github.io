But here\u2019s how you can easily adopt it for a healthy lifestyle\n\nImage for representation only\n\nSelf-care has become a popular term across the world in recent years, but do you know what exactly it means or why it is important? Maybe not, because self-care is relatively a new concept in Nepal, and self-care tips are hardly heard in the public discourse here.\n\nAt its core, self-care involves taking intentional actions that benefit your mental and physical health and help you cope with life better. Whether through exercise, meditation, or setting boundaries, self-care is about you and how you can prioritise your well-being.\n\nAnd no, you do not need to spend a lot of money, regardless of what you have been told or heard as there are many free or low-cost activities that can be just as effective. You just need time and your commitment to making small changes for your overall well-being.\n\nSo here are some easy self-care tips that you can apply.\n\n1. It is not being selfish\n\nRepresentational image.

It can be anything that makes you happy or content as physical activity or spending time alone or with loved ones can be examples of you prioritising yourself and practising self-care.\n\nSetting limits or creating boundaries and communicating your requirements clearly and assertively are essential in self-care. Once you achieve something, which might seem trivial to others, celebrating your accomplishments and exploring various activities to find new things you love will help you. Self-care tips are not about one-size-fits-all, so take your time and invest in yourself for a happier, healthier existence.\n\n2. Set boundaries\n\nRepresentational graphic.

Individuals may communicate their limits clearly and assertively by saying \u201cno\u201d to commitments that do not correspond with their beliefs or needs. And, it is okay to do so.\n\nTo minimise work-related burnout, you can set healthy boundaries by including a self-care regimen that prioritises rest and establishing reasonable deadlines. Setting limits is ultimately crucial for managing time and energy, developing meaningful relationships, and living a better and healthier life. But boundaries must be communicated with loved ones, employers, or coworkers in order to strengthen relationships and safeguard an individual\u2019s mental and emotional health.\n\n3. Prioritise sleep\n\nFile image\n\nThis is the first thing you should work on. And it cannot be stated enough how critical it is to prioritise your sleep. As advised, it should be seven to eight hours of sleep per night; \u201cevery night\u201d is the key phrase here. To take care of both physical and mental health for total well-being, you need to sleep and have a relaxing bedtime routine.\n\nA balanced diet can also help by preventing physical sickness and promoting cognitive as well as emotional well-being. Regular exercise, on the other hand, reduces stress and betters your mood. By doing so, you are making long-term decisions for your well-being and they are very essential self-care tips that you need to follow. Finally, as mentioned above, this is something you can do for free.\n\n4. Regular exercise\n\nRepresentational image\n\nThe importance of regular exercise has been emphasised a lot already, connecting it to sound mental and physical health. But among all self-care tips, this one has been commercialised more. Exercise on a regular basis can not only enhance physical health but also lower stress and increase happiness. Apart from exercise, meditation, and spending time in nature can improve your mental health.\n\nMany studies have already proved that physical activity can alleviate melancholy and anxiety symptoms, increase mood, and boost self-esteem. Other studies say you can minimise your risk of chronic diseases too with exercise. Additionally, eating a nutritious diet, and getting adequate sleep will also be good. But you do not have to join the gyms per se; a light walk and a few stretching routines can also be enough sometimes.\n\n5. Eat a balanced and nutritious diet\n\nPhoto: Pexels/ Maarten van den Heuvel\n\nStressing again, it is critical to recognise that your physical and mental health are inextricably linked to taking care of your physical health. A diet, high in whole and unprocessed food, can also help reduce inflammation in the body, which has been related to a variety of physical and mental health issues.\n\nIncorporating fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and whole grains into meals can enhance both physical and mental health. It is one of the easiest self-care tips as you take care of yourself just by eating. Certain nutrients\u2013such as Omega-3, fatty acids and B vitamins\u2013have been demonstrated to boost mood and alleviate anxiety and depression symptoms.\n\n6. Practise mindfulness\n\nWhen talking about self-care tips, practising mindfulness is an essential one. For general well-being and burnout, it can be proven very helpful, it might be difficult to make time for activities that are very long amid your hectic schedules and commitments. But mindfulness can be practised via meditation or deep breathing exercises, and one can prioritise self-care just by immersing oneself fully in the present moment.\n\nYou can invest in your well-being and happiness just by making self-care a constant part of your routine. Take some five minutes to take long breaths, calm your mind, play one round of your favourite mobile games or other slightly simple but longer activities like stretching or reading can also help model your good behaviours. You can also be influential on others, and the community or improve all your relationships. This, like other self-care tips, can help lower your stress and encourage the management of your emotions for peace and relaxation.\n\n7. Consistency is essential\n\nRepresentational graphic.

It does not have to be fancy or expensive; it may be as easy as stretching or reading a book for a few minutes. Prioritising self-care may improve both physical and mental health by increasing resilience and coping abilities to better deal with life\u2019s obstacles.\n\nAs additional self-care tips, you also find activities that work for you and commit to them on a continuous basis to provide the groundwork for a happier, healthier, and more satisfying life.","title":"Top 7 easy-to-follow self-care tips for a healthy lifestyle","url":"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/top-easy-self-care-tips-healthy-life.html","video":[]}
