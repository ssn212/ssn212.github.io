At least 12 others were injured or treated for anxiety due to the mayhem, according to police.\n\n\u201cAs they heard the gunfire, it was obviously chaos,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cWe had hundreds of people in Monroe Park, so people scattered. It was very chaotic at the scene.\u201d\n\nEdwards said one of the people who was killed was an 18-year-old male student who had just graduated, while the other was a 36-year-old man who was there for the graduation. Their names were not released, but police believe the suspect, who was not immediately identified, knew at least one of the victims.\n\n\u201cThis should have been a safe space. People should have felt safe at a graduation,\u201d Edwards said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just incredibly tragic that someone decided to bring a gun to this incident and rain terror on our community.\u201d\n\nSix people were brought to VCU Medical Center and their conditions ranged from serious to critical late Tuesday, VCU Health System spokesperson Mary Kate Brogan said.\n\nMultiple handguns were recovered. Police initially said two suspects were detained, but Edwards said later that they determined one of them was not involved.\n\nRichmond Mayor Levar Stoney vowed to ensure anyone responsible faces justice.\n\n\u201cThis should not be happening anywhere,\u201d Stoney said.\n\nOfficers inside the theater, where the graduation ceremony for Huguenot High School had been taking place, heard gunfire around 5:15 p.m. and radioed to police stationed outside, who found multiple victims, Edwards said.\n\nSchool board member Jonathan Young told Richmond TV station WWBT that graduates and other attendees were leaving the building when they heard about 20 gunshots in rapid succession.\n\n\u201cThat prompted, as you would expect, hundreds of persons in an effort to flee the gunfire to return to the building,\u201d Young said.\n\n\u201cIt materialized in a stampede,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo people were treated for falls; one juvenile was struck by a car and sustained injuries that were not life-threatening; and nine people were treated at the scene for minor injuries or anxiety, according to police spokeswoman Tracy Walker.\n\nRichmond Public Schools Superintendent Jason Kamras said the new graduates were outside taking photos with families and friends when the shooting broke out.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any more words on this,\u201d Kamras said. \u201cI\u2019m just tired of seeing people get shot, our kids get shot. And I beg of the entire community to stop, to just stop.\u201d\n\nAs he heard the gunshots and then sirens, neighbor John Willard, 69, stepped onto the balcony of his 18th-floor apartment. Below, he saw students fleeing in their graduation outfits and parents hugging children.\n\n\u201cThere was one poor woman in front of the apartment block next to ours who was wailing and crying,\u201d Willard said, adding that the scene left him deeply saddened.\n\nEdythe Payne was helping her daughter sell flowers outside the theater to students as they left the ceremony. She told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that the shooting caused a panic on nearby Main Street, which was packed with people at the time.\n\n\u201cI felt bad because some elderly people were at the graduation and they got knocked down to the ground,\u201d Payne said.\n\nThe school district said a different graduation scheduled for later Tuesday had been canceled \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d and schools would be closed Wednesday.\n\nThe mass shooting, the latest in a nation increasingly accustomed to them, prompted calls for reform.\n\n\u201cThe gun violence epidemic is a public health crisis that we must address,\u201d U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, a Democrat whose district includes Richmond, said in a statement. \u201cWe cannot continue to live in fear. We must address the root causes of gun violence and pass common sense gun safety policies that protect our communities.\u201d\n\nRepublican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, an ardent gun-rights advocate, said in remarks to news outlets near the scene that the problem lies not with guns but with criminals.\n\n\u201cWe have to figure out what\u2019s going on in our communities,\u201d she said.","title":"2 dead in shooting after high school graduation ceremony in US","url":"http://en.setopati.com/International/161192","video":[]}
