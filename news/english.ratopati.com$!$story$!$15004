Fifty roapanis land and three-feet road have sunk in the area, said local resident Gopal Dhakal. Transportation service for the local people would be cut if immediate measures are not taken in controlling the landslip, said the local people.\n\nLikewise, the road leading to remote Kerabari village at the border of Melamchi municipality in Sindhupalchok district has caved in. Rampant use of excavators on the road has caused the problem, according to locals. Similarly, the road linking Melamchi is in a sorry state, leading to difficulty for vehicles to pass.\n\nHowever, local level is unconcerned about the matter. Mayor of Shankharapur municipality has recently inspected the road and the settlement at risk. He suggested that a study of the settlement and road at risk should be carried out. Initiatives would be taken to control the landslide, he said.","title":"60 houses at Shankharapur municipality at risk of landslide","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/15004","video":[]}
