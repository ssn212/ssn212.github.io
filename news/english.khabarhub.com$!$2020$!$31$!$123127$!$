Such treatment can negatively affect those with the disease, as well as their caregivers, family, friends, and communities.\n\nThe current COVID-19 outbreak has provoked social stigma and discriminatory behaviours against people including health workers, as well as anyone perceived to have been in contact with the virus. .Even those who have recovered from COVID-19 face such discrimination.\n\nIn Nepal, Incidents have been reported from Sindhuli, Kathmandu, and Dang districts that health care professionals have been forced to leave their rented accommodation due to their profession.\n\nWhat brings Social Stigma?\n\nThere are some factors such as anxiety, fear, confusion, and uncertainty which fuels social stigma and stereotypes to other groups of people.\n\nAnxiety caused by lockdowns, many unknowns around COVID-19, and the fear of being infected has given rise to stigma in local communities.\n\nPeople\u2019s uncertainty and anxiety have led them to believe biased and vague information provided by traditional media, social media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.).\n\nWhat are the impacts of Social Stigma?\n\nStigma can make people feel isolated and even abandoned. They may feel depressed, hurt, and angry when friends and others in their community avoid them for fear of getting COVID-19.\n\nThis can result in more severe health problems and difficulties controlling a disease outbreak.\n\nStigma can:\n\nDrive people to hide the illness to avoid discrimination\n\nPrevent people from seeking health care immediately\n\nDiscourage them from adopting healthy behaviours\n\nFour ways to prevent Covid-19 Stigma\n\nSpreading the Facts\n\nStigma can be heightened by insufficient knowledge about how the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is transmitted and treated, and how to prevent infection.\n\nTo overcome this, sharing facts, not fear will stop the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We must share only the authentic information available on the website of the Ministry of Health, Nepal Government, or the World Health Organisation.\n\nAlso, we should cross-check any information related to CoVID-19 from reliable sources before forwarding any messages on social media.\n\nShowing Support\n\nWe must support health care workers and others who are caring for people with COVID-19 and thank them for their work and share positive messages on social media.\n\nAlso, police officers, bus drivers, cleaners and other essential workers need our full support and we must thank all who continue their essential jobs to help us and our community.\n\nShowing Compassion\n\nPeople who are sick with the coronavirus have done nothing wrong, so let\u2019s not treat them differently. If anybody catches the infection, it is not their fault.\n\nIn a situation of distress, the patient and the family need love, support, encouragement, and cooperation. While the governments and front workers are doing their best to go through this emergency, everyone should do the best to spread kindness, solidarity, and support.\n\nPeople have to be supportive and empathetic to the people involved, not only because it could happen to anyone but because we are part of a huge single-family called humankind.\n\nRaising Awareness\n\nOnce we acquire the knowledge and factual information about Covid-19, raising awareness program will be very effective to combat stigma.\n\nSocial media will be the best platform to do that where likeminded people can conduct the campaign. #spreadlove, initiated by Unicef Nepal is the best example of a social media campaign against Covid-19 related stigma.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic will be over sooner if fears and rumours are replaced by facts, proper action, and a show of support for one another. Let\u2019s fight the virus, not the human.\n\n(The writer is an MBA, University of Wales, UK)","title":"An Ultimate Guide to Prevent Social Stigma related to Covid-19 - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/31/123127/","video":[]}
