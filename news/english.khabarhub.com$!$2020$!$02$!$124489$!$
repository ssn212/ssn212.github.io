The concept of the wall, which was set up at Reyukai Chautari of the Itahari square, was to run a cloth bank.\n\nIn cloth bank, capable and supportive people would drop their clothes and needy people could take them away for their use. \u201dThe concept was a huge success in Itahari as so many people turned out to donate clothes for needy people,\u201d said Bharat Shrestha, the co-coordinator of the program.\n\nAfter one year of its inception, now, the supportive wall has turned from clothing junction to the food bank for needy people. \u201dWe have converted our concept from clothes to food as the COVID-19 has troubled many people from lowest section of our society,\u201d said Shrestha.\n\nHe added, \u201dPeople are joining hands to support our campaign. We have been collecting hand sanitizers, facemasks, daily eatables like rice, lentils, salt, sugar, oil, vegetables, flattened rice, among others, for affected people.\u201d Shrestha said they have distributed food and other necessary items to around 500 people of Itahari 6 and 9.\n\n\u201dThe number will be increasing in the days ahead,\u201d said Shrestha. He said the support program is mainly targeted to daily wage earners and homeless people.\n\nSince August 26, Yosha Guragain of Itahari-4 ran another food bank to support marginalized section of the society including Dalits and daily wage earners of Itahari.\n\nSince the beginning of the food bank more than 300 families are benefited from this food bank until September 1, said Guragain. She added, \u201dWe have distributed our food items to the needy people of Itahari 1, 3, 4, 17 and surrounding wards of Itahari.\u201d\n\nLiberal Society, a philanthropic network of youths of Tarahara of Itahari, is also distributing nutritious food items to infected people. \u201dSince August 31, we are distributing nutritious food like eggs, bananas, fresh juice, facemask, sanitizer, home-made herbs and other necessary items,\u201d said Subekchhu Dewan Rai, the chair of the society.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe reached out to 6 infected patients and handed over our support. This was also a program to inspire people to be more empathetic to the pandemic patients. We did so after many instances of hatreds at the patients were surfaced in various places of Nepal including in Itahari ward number 5.\u201d\n\nFood bank for needy journalists\n\nFood banks run by Bharat Shrestha and Yosha Guragain and nutritious food delivery program by Subekchhu Dewan Rai are mainly focused on public. There is another functional food bank in Itahari which is for professional section of the society.\n\nOn 20 August, a meeting of Press Union Sunsari decided to establish food bank to support needy journalists of the district. Journalists living in Itahari, Dharan, Jhumka, among others, were provided food items. Around 53 journalists are given the support at their doorsteps until September 1, informed Pawan Adhikari, the chair of Press Union Sunsari.\n\nEvery needy journalist was given daily eatables including 25 kg rice, 2 kg lentil, 2 kg salt, 2 litres oil and other food items like flattened rice, dry soya chunks, among others. The food bank was not funded by outside but only by journalists, said chair Adhikari.\n\nBefore the establishment of food bank, Press Union Sunsari had insured 260 working journalists of the district and also managed to fund the treatment of journalists at Nobel Medical College of Biratnagar.\n\nDisinfection drive in full swing\n\nBesides establishing food banks to help support needy people and delivering nutritious eatables to the pandemic patients, locals of Itahari are also joining forces for disinfection drives.\n\nAspatal Tole Bikas Sanstha of Itahari-9 started disinfection drive for the first time. Chair Bijay KC-led disinfection drive carried its task in all important areas of the locality.\n\nSince, August 21 all areas of the ward number 9 of Itahari Sub-Metropolis were disinfected. \u201dCommunity donors and volunteers supported this cause\u201d, said KC.\n\nLiberal Society of Itahari-20 Tarahara carried out disinfection drive since August 24. \u201dWe sanitized public places and some areas near by infected locals by using sodium hydrochloride \u201d, said Subekchhu Dewan Rai, the chair of the society.\n\nHe added, \u201dThe program titled \u2018Let\u2019s Fight Against Corona\u2019 was funded by members and sympathizers of our society.\u201d\n\nLions Club of Itahari Active has also thrown its weight behind 20-day-long disinfection drive, the longest one in the town. Starting from August 24, the campaign will last until September 13, informed Jitendra Thapa, who is actively engaged in the program.\n\nRanju Sigdel, Punya Poudel, Navin Pokhrel, Madan Chudal, among others, is actively participated in the disinfection drive. \u201dWe have covered disinfection and sanitization programs in ward number 4, 5 and 12 already\u201d, said Thapa, \u201dToday (September 1), we are scheduled to do our task on ward number 9 and 3 until evening.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201dThis disinfection and sanitization drive is performed for two reasons. One, to contribute our societal responsibility from our organization. Two, to boost emotional strength of locals by disinfecting in areas where there are more cases of the pandemic in the town.\u201d","title":"Locals gear up to support poor and pandemic patients in Itahari - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/02/124489/","video":[]}
