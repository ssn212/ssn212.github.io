She had sent a seven-point message to inform the federal parliament and for deliberation, and another eight-point message for drawing attention.\n\nThe then spokesperson at the President's Office Sagar Acharya issuing a statement had said that Bhandari had sent back the bill to the HoR for reconsideration as per Article 113 (3) of the Constitution.\n\nThe then president Bhandari had mainly raised two issues while sending the bill back. She had mentioned that the bill was silent about the provision of naturalized citizenship through marriage as per Article 11 (6) of the Constitution.\n\n\"If a foreign woman married to a Nepali citizen so wishes, she may acquire naturalized citizenship of Nepal as provided for in a Federal law,\" states Article 11(6) of the Constitution. The then president Bhandari had pointed that the Constitution clearly says federal law but the bill passed by the federal parliament did not have that provision.\n\nShe had also raised question about the provision requiring self-declaration by a woman to provide citizenship to her children.\n\nShe had also drawn the House's attention to other issues but had mainly asked the House to reconsider the two issues.\n\nThe bill does not propose any restrictions on foreigners marrying Nepali citizens while acquiring naturalized citizenship. The main opposition CPN-UML, to which Bhandari was affiliated before becoming president, has been protesting removal of the provision in the report submitted by the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the HoR that required foreigners marrying Nepali citizens to wait for seven years to get naturalized citizenship.\n\nThe bill passed by the federal parliament also has a provision to grant citizenship by descent to the children of those who received citizenship by birth through a one-time arrangement after the Janaandolan II in 2006.\n\nCitizenship by birth was granted to persons born in Nepal before mid-April 1990, and having permanent domicile and been continuously resident in Nepal throughout their life through the one-time arrangement.\n\nThe passed bill also allows citizenship to a person only through the name of mother but has put four conditions for that. The child should be born in Nepal, should be residing in Nepal, father should be unidentified and the person should make self-declaration that the father has not been identified for that.\n\nThe person taking the citizenship certificate can choose to take the surname and address of either the father or mother. The bill has also paved the way for non-resident citizenship to anyone living outside the SAARC countries if there is proof that the person's father/mother or grandfather/grandmother is/was a Nepali citizen.\n\nThe then president Bhandari had earlier authenticated an ordinance, sent by the then prime minister KP Sharma Oli after dissolving the House, that included similar provisions.","title":"Citizenship Bill is already dead: SC Bar Chair Niraula tells President Paudel","url":"http://en.setopati.com/political/161012","video":[]}
