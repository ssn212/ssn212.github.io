Such mechanism should give priority to the special needs of the LLDCs that require capacity development to harness trade, achieve structural economic transformation and to realize the SDGs,\u201d Oli said.\n\nPrime Minister Oli further said that financial support to LLDCs is critical to boost up the urgently needed resilient infrastructure and trade facilitation mechanisms for smooth flow of goods which are key to their recovery, saying LLDCs need to be supported in their efforts to achieve digital transformation.\n\nSimilarly, he said, \u201cWe call on the international community to support development of strong and resilient health systems, underpinned by universal health coverage, that focus on equitable access, quality and financial protection, and easy and affordable access to vaccines once they are released.\u201d\n\nConcrete support measures should be put in place to address debt vulnerabilities including through debt cancellation for highly indebted countries, debt relief by international creditors, exchange or reprofile debt to reduce debt service, writing-off debt, debt swaps for highly indebted countries, debt buy-backs and support market access, added PM Oli.\n\nHe further said \u201cWe call on our development partners to maintain current official development assistance levels given its crucial importance to support our countries to recover sustainably. Among the LLDCs, the financial gap to implement the SDGs appears more acute in the LDCs. They need predictable external support measures in the form of aid, investment, technology innovation, development and transfer.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Oli called on International Financial Institutions to prioritize the special needs of the LLDCs in their recovery efforts, requesting the UN system and other international and regional organizations to give priority support to the LLDCs\u2019 recovery efforts \u2013 including the effective execution of Roadmap for accelerated implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action.\n\n\u201cWe call on the private sector to actively engage in the recovery efforts, particularly in sustainable development projects, including through the PPPs.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, Prime Minister Oli reiterated the unfailing support of the LLDC Member States in implementing the global development agenda.","title":"COVID-19 pandemic putting our economies under stress: PM Oli - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/29/131488/","video":[]}
