Beijing said that Yellen stated during the talks the U.S. \u201cdoes not seek \u2018decoupling and disconnection\u2019 and has no intention of hindering China\u2019s modernization process.\u201d\n\nThe foreign ministry said, \u201cChina and the United States should strengthen coordination and cooperation, join hands to tackle global challenges and promote common development.\u201d\n\nWhile both sides described Yellen\u2019s visit in positive terms, no new plans for more high-level meetings were announced.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s going to continue to be around and be a major player on the world stage,\u201d White House press secretary Karin Jean Pierre said Friday, adding that an intense competition requires intense diplomacy.\n\n\u201cSo it is important to have an intense competition requires intense diplomacy,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you see Secretary Yellen do, that\u2019s what you saw Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken do. These are the type of conversations that the president has had with President Xi in meetings that he\u2019s had with him as well,\u201d she said.\n\nThe U.S. treasury secretary began a four-day visit to China on Friday by calling for market reforms in the world\u2019s second-largest economy, and warning that the United States and its allies will fight back against what she called China\u2019s \u201cunfair economic practices.\u201d\n\nSpeaking Friday in Beijing to the American Chamber of Commerce in China, Yellen said, \u201cThe United States does not seek a wholesale separation of our economies. \u2026 The decoupling of the world\u2019s two largest economies would be destabilizing for the global economy, and it would be virtually impossible to undertake.\u201d\n\nAnd while she noted the importance of trade and investment with China, Yellen also \u201craised concerns, including barriers to market access, China\u2019s use of non-market tools, and punitive actions that have been taken against U.S. firms in recent months,\u201d during a roundtable with more than 10 U.S. businesses operating in Beijing.\n\n\u201cShe also reaffirmed the U.S. economic approach to China, which remains focused on three primary objectives: securing vital interests pertaining to national security and human rights; pursuing healthy and mutually beneficial economic competition, in which China plays by international rules; and seeking mutual cooperation on urgent global challenges, including on the macroeconomy, climate, and global debt,\u201d according to a Treasury Department statement Friday.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry said in its statement, \u201cthe two sides should strengthen communication and seek consensus on important issues in the bilateral economic field through candid, in-depth, and pragmatic exchanges, so as to inject stability and positive energy into Chinese-U.S. economic relations.\u201d\n\nYellen arrived in Beijing Thursday and tweeted, U.S. President Joe Biden \u201ccharged his administration with deepening communication between our two countries on a range of issues, and I look forward to doing so during my visit.\u201d\n\n(VOA)","title":"US Treasury Secretary holds \u2018candid and constructive\u2019 talks with China\u2019s PM","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/08/310022/","video":[]}
