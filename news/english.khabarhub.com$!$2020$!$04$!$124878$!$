Prime Minister Oli in jocular, yet witty remarks had told NCP Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal that he was \u201centrapped\u201d once again.\n\nGautam had expressed his intention to become the NA lawmaker public recently after sensing Prime Minister Oli was preparing to give continuity to Khatiwada.\n\nPrime Minister Oli and NCP Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal had on Wednesday held talks on the agendas of the Secretariat meeting.\n\nForget it. Thursday\u2019s decision was undoubtedly highly dramatic at a time when the majority of the country\u2019s population is under lockdown in response to the coronavirus crisis with as many as 300 deaths as of today.\n\nIt was the same Bamdev, who on July 28, mooted a six-point proposal that suggested that PM Oli continued as Prime Minister and party Chairman until the next General Convention.\n\nAll these developments, particularly the decision to bring Bamdev to the National Assembly, took place against the backdrop of a looming economic recession fueled by the impact of the pandemic.\n\nThe events of the past several months have led to changes in NCP political landscape, including the dramatic \u201clove-hate\u201d episodes between NCP Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Prime Minister Oli.\n\nPM Oli, who faced the prospect of declining fortunes, was able to retain both his crucial positions as the NCP Chairman and the Prime Minister.\n\nComing back to Bamdev\u2019s shrewdness, he did everything from shifting allegiance to PM Oli from the Dahal camp for the sake of being nominated to the NA.\n\nIt was the same Bamdev, who on July 28, mooted a six-point proposal that suggested that PM Oli continued as Prime Minister and party Chairman until the next General Convention.\n\nConsider this: Bamdev, who was in the camp of Dahal and NCP senior leader Madhav Kumar Nepal, issued a statement on August 5 clarifying that he was not with any camp within the party.\n\nBamdev even attempted to make an NCP lawmaker vacate a parliamentary constituency for him so that he could contest the election.\n\nNow with the developments so far, a layman\u2019s question could be how is NCP going to benefit with Gautam\u2019s nomination?","title":"Bamdev Episode: What will NCP gain? - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/04/124878/","video":[]}
