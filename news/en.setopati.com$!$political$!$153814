The banned mobile applications are prejudicial to the sovereignty, integrity, defence of India and public order, the ministry said.\n\nThe banned apps include Baidu, Baidu Express Edition, Tencent Watchlist, FaceU, WeChat Reading and Tencent Weiyun, besides PUBG Mobile and PUBG Mobile Lite, the statement read.\n\nThe ministry of electronics and information technology received several complaints from various sources, including reports about misuse of some mobile apps available on the Android and iOS platforms. The complaints alleged stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users\u2019 data in an unauthorized manner to servers which possibly had locations outside India.\n\n\u201cThe compilation of these data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Center, under the Ministry of Home Affairs also sent a recommendation for blocking these controversial apps. In the public domain too, there has been a strong demand for some time to take strict action against mobile applications that harm India\u2019s sovereignty as well as the privacy of citizens.\n\nEarlier in June, the Center had banned 59, mostly Chinese, mobile applications such as TikTok, UC Browser and WeChat, citing concerns that these are \u2018prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order\u2019.","title":"India bans 118 mostly Chinese mobile apps Including PUBG","url":"http://en.setopati.com/political/153814","video":[]}
