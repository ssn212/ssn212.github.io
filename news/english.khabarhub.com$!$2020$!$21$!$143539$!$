The program was distributed after the sloganeering.\n\nSenior leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal have demanded action against those involved in the indecent behavior.\n\nPandey also said that a group led by the advisor to the chief minister and personal secretary of the chief minister of Bagmati Province had chanted slogans at the event in a planned manner.\n\nHere\u2019s what Pandey told Khabarhub:\n\nI was talking. As soon as I went to participate in the program, Mayor Prabha Baral came. She was accompanied by 9-10 boys. They were sitting together. The boys applauded Mayor Prabha for taking the seat. These seemed to have come in a special way.\n\nThey were applauding in the same way while Prabha was speaking.\n\nThen others started talking. When it was my turn, I started explaining how the task force worked, how various foundations within the party formed factions within the party.\n\nAll of sudden, they started shouting slogans. These boys are not people with political status. They are the only people who volunteer in the election.\n\nJagannath Thapaliya is an advisor to the Chief Minister of the Province. He is also the personal assistant of Province Minister Dawa Lama as Lama is also his son-in-law by relation. The boys came under his leadership.\n\nThat is not a political way, it is a non-political way. They were not a member of any party committee. They were general supporters, people walking in the election. It was understood they were sent by someone. It was understood by that the way to come there and the way to applaud among others.\n\nIt is a non-political thing. They have no knowledge of our debates in politics. These are not issues of concern to them. They do not even have the guts to understand the discussion that is taking place. They were not the people with that ability.","title":"Surendra Pandey says he was mistreated in a planned way\u00a0 - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/21/143539/","video":[]}
