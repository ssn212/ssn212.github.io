It explicitly outlines eight scenarios where it is difficult for a victim to \"form, express, or fulfill an intention not to consent\" to sexual intercourse.\n\nThese include situations where the victim is intoxicated with alcohol or drugs; or subject to violence or threats; or is \"frightened or astonished\". Another scenario appears to describe an abuse of power, where the victim is \"worried\" of the consequences of refusal.\n\nThe legal age of consent, previously at 13 and one of the lowest among developed nations, has been raised to 16 years. However, a person who has had sex with a minor aged 13 to 15 will be punished only if the person is five or more years older than the minor.\n\nThis is only the first time Japan has changed its age of consent since its enactment in 1907.\n\nMeanwhile, the statute of limitations or legal window for reporting rape will be extended to 15 years from 10 years, to give survivors more time to come forward.\n\nNew laws passed on Friday also ban \"photo voyeurism\" which includes upskirting and secret filming of sexual acts, among other things.\n\nJapan has been looking at several penal codes changes to strengthen legislation against sex crimes after multiple rape acquittals in 2019 caused a national outcry.\n\nThat same year, the nationwide Flower Demo campaign against sexual violence started. On the 11th day of every month since April 2019, activists would gather throughout Japan to demand justice and show solidarity with sexual assault survivors.\n\n(BBC)","title":"Japan rewrites sex crime laws in landmark move","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/28301/japan-rewrites-sex-crime-laws-","video":[]}
