When it senses the opportune moment, it pounces, aiming for the neck to immobilize the prey. For the next two to three days, it will feast on this single kill.\n\nUntil a few years ago, snow leopards, also known as the \u201cghosts of the mountains,\u201d were believed to be the only surviving apex predator in this part of the world. But the vulnerable species, already facing pressure from common leopards and even tigers moving to higher altitudes, faces an old nemesis from the dog family that has returned to this region after decades.\n\n\u201cThe Himalayan wolf had vanished from Nepal for over four decades when it started reappearing in different areas,\u201d said researcher Bikram Shrestha. \u201cPeople said they would kill or poison the wolves as they killed their livestock and even attacked humans.\u201d\n\nReturn of the wolf\n\nA Himalayan wolf.

They rely on speed and endurance to chase and exhaust their prey, often over long distances. Wolf packs have even been known to bring down the mighty yak, one of the largest species of wild cattle in the world.\n\nBut they mostly go after smaller prey, and in the Himalayas, this means the naur, or blue sheep \u2014 which is also the main prey of the snow leopard. New research now shows that the wolves\u2019 reemergence could already be impacting naur populations, and thus snow leopards in some areas of Nepal.\n\nThe researchers, led by Kamal Thapa from Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu, observed and collected data on the behaviour of naur in two different valleys, Manang and Nar Phu. The former is home to both snow leopards and wolves, while the latter has only snow leopards as the top predator.\n\nThey then watched the naur, using visual observations and GPS tracking, to see how they behaved when predators were around. They also counted how many naur there were, how big their groups were, and the ratio between males and females in both the spring and autumn seasons.\n\nThey found that the naur behaved differently depending on which predators were around. Those in Manang, where wolves were present, were twice as vigilant as the naur in Nar Phu, where there were no wolves.\n\n\u201cThe snow leopard has been the resident apex predator for a long time, and the naur also know about its strategies,\u201d Thapa said. \u201cHowever, the wolf is new to the ecosystem, and as they don\u2019t know how to deal with it, they need to remain in constant vigilance.\u201d\n\nConservationists say snow leopards are already having to deal with the upward shift in habitat of common leopards and tigers. Snow leopards, because of their shy nature, size, and style of hunting, stand to lose the most as the wolves move in, they say.\n\n\u201cThe wolf definitely adds more pressure to snow leopards as their presence will leave a big impact on the prey,\u201d Shrestha said.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just through direct competition for prey that the snow leopards could lose out, Thapa said.\n\n\u201cOur findings have implications for the conservation of snow leopards,\u201d he said.\n\nNaur find themselves most vulnerable when foraging, he said, and with the need for greater vigilance, they will have less energy to spend on feeding, which could leave them with a deficiency of nutrition.\n\n\u201cThis could affect the long-term health and reproduction patterns of the prime food of snow leopards,\u201d Thapa said.\n\nHimalayan ecology at risk\n\nThe return of wolves to Nepal\u2019s Himalayan region is putting greater pressure on populations of naur, or blue sheep.

Snow leopards largely evaded this threat, thanks to their elusive nature and camouflage skills. Global attention towards their conservation also helped boost their populations, researchers say.\n\nIn an ironic twist, the return of the wolves is likely also due to herders, many of whom buy domesticated yak from across the border in Tibet.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a theory that the wolves from Tibet followed the yaks to Nepal and recolonised the area,\u201d Thapa said.\n\nShrestha said the conservation focus should now be on improving the prey population so that both snow leopards and wolves have enough to eat.\n\n\u201cWe have had many snow leopard conservation projects in the mountains. But we now need prey-base conservation programs,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the naur, this could give it the breathing room it needs to adapt to the growing presence of wolves.\n\n\u201cIn the long-term, the naur will develop their own strategy to deal with the wolves,\u201d Thapa said.\n\nHe noted that snow leopards prefer to attack on rugged terrain, while wolves prefer a flatter landscape. The naur may come to understand this and change its habitats slowly, Thapa said.\n\nResearcher Madhu Chetri said that although he agrees with the principle findings of the study, the short distance between the two valleys could have affected the results as wolves have a large home range.\n\nIn any case, the re-emergence of wolves is likely to exacerbate human-wildlife conflict in the Himalayas \u2014 the very reason they were driven out of Nepal\u2019s Himalayas to begin with.\n\n\u201cWe need to ensure that people get timely compensation for losses caused by both snow leopards and wolves,\u201d Thapa said.\n\nThis story first appeared on Mongabay and Onlinekhabar is republishing it under a Creative Commons licence.","title":"Return of the wolf to Nepal\u2019s Himalayas may threaten snow leopards","url":"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wolf-threat-snow-leopards.html","video":[]}
