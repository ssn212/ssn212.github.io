In 2014, a national survey found that around 30% of Chinese college graduates continued to live with their parents.\n\nBut parental support is a double-edged sword when it comes to youth unemployment.\n\nWhile some young workers cannot get by without their parents\u2019 support, others are choosing not to work precisely because their parents can afford to support them.\n\nYoung Chinese who were born in urban areas usually have parents or grandparents who own apartments in the city center, owing to the mass transfer of property rights from the state to residents during the 1990s housing reforms.\n\nAnd the one-child policy that was in force between 1978 and 2016 means that these young people have no siblings and thus stand to inherit prime real estate.\n\nIf you are in this situation and your parents can cover your living expenses, why bother to work for a pittance?\n\nChina thus needs not only more jobs, but more high-paying jobs. That is a tall order for any economy; but China will face additional headwinds.\n\nThe Chinese economy urgently needs new cohorts of highly productive workers to help sustain a rapidly growing elderly population.\n\nFor example, youth unemployment tends to cause other problems, such as increased crime and social and political instability.\n\nResearch also shows that youth unemployment depresses lifetime earnings, because it means that young people are missing important opportunities to develop skills.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, one year of unemployment at age 22 has been shown to depress wages by 13-21% 20 years later.\n\nProlonged, widespread youth unemployment can have profoundly negative long-run macroeconomic consequences anywhere.\n\nBut it is especially a problem for China, now that it has one of the world\u2019s largest and fastest-aging populations.\n\nThe Chinese economy urgently needs new cohorts of highly productive workers to help sustain a rapidly growing elderly population.\n\nMore than ever, Chinese policymakers need to focus on economic growth.\n\n(Nancy Qian, Professor of Economics at Northwestern University, is a co-director of Northwestern University\u2019s Global Poverty Research Lab and Founding Director of China Econ Lab)\n\nCopyright: Project Syndicate","title":"China\u2019s Youth Unemployment Problem","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/27/305158/","video":[]}
