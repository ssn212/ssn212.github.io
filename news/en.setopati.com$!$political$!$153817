It said that it expects a long recovery, and it still can\u2019t rule out long-term consequences from the poisoning.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel says Navalny was the victim of an \u201cattempted murder by poisoning\u201d and the aim was to silence him. After that finding was announced Wednesday, Merkel said there are \u201cvery serious questions that only the Russian government can answer and must answer.\u201d\n\nMerkel\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said that testing by a special German military laboratory at the request of the Berlin hospital where Navalny remains in a coma showed \u201cproof without doubt of a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok group.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a dismaying event that Alexei Navalny was the victim of an attack with a chemical nerve agent in Russia,\u201d Seibert said in a statement. \u201cThe German government condemns this attack in the strongest terms.\u201d\n\nNavalny, a politician and corruption investigator who is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s fiercest critics, fell ill on a flight back to Moscow from Siberia on Aug 20 and was taken to a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk after the plane made an emergency landing.\n\nHe was transferred two days later to Berlin\u2019s Charit\u00e9 hospital, where doctors last week said initial tests indicated Navalny had been poisoned.\n\nBritish authorities identified Novichok as the poison used in 2018 on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England. The nerve agent is a cholinesterase inhibitor, part of the class of substances that doctors at Charite said last week had shown up in Navalny\u2019s system.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the Russian ambassador was summoned to his ministry Wednesday and told in \u201cunmistakable\u201d terms of Germany\u2019s call for the Navalny case to be investigated \u201cin full and with full transparency.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe now know that there was an attack with a chemical nerve agent,\u201d Mass said. \u201cThat makes it even more urgent to determine who was responsible in Russia and to hold them to account.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin remained tight-lipped and said it hadn\u2019t been informed, even though its ambassador in Berlin had been summoned.\n\nSeibert said the German government would inform its partners in the European Union and NATO about the test results. He said it wants to consult with them in light of the Russian response \u201con an appropriate joint response.\u201d Germany also will contact the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, he added.\n\n\u201cRussia itself should have a serious interest in good relations with its neighbors in Europe,\u201d said Maas, the foreign minister. \u201cNow at the very latest, it is the time to make a decisive contribution toward this.\u201d\n\nIn an update shortly after the government\u2019s announcement, the Charite hospital said that Navalny is still in intensive care and remains on a ventilator. But it said that he \u201ccontinues to improve.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecovery is likely to be lengthy,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cIt is still too early to gauge the long-term effects, which may arise in relation to this severe poisoning.\u201d\n\nNavalny\u2019s allies in Russia have insisted he was deliberately poisoned by the country\u2019s authorities, accusations that the Kremlin rejected as \u201cempty noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo poison Navalny with Novichok in 2020 would be exactly the same as leaving an autograph at a crime scene, like this one,\u201d Navalny\u2019s longtime ally and strategist Leonid Volkov said in a tweet that featured a photo of Putin\u2019s name and a signature next to it.\n\nThe Russian doctors who treated Navalny in Siberia repeatedly contested the German hospital\u2019s poisoning conclusion, saying they had ruled out poisoning as a diagnosis and that their tests for cholinesterase inhibitors came back negative.\n\nNovichok is a class of military-grade nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War. Western weapons experts say it was only ever manufactured in Russia. After the Skripals were poisoned, Russia said the U.S., Britain and other Western countries acquired the expertise to make the nerve agent after the Soviet Union collapsed, and that the Novichok used in the attack could have come from them.\n\nAccording to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, there is no record of Novichok having been declared by any nation that signed the chemical weapons convention.\n\n\u201cUnless you are working for the military, it is impossible to be accidentally exposed,\u201d Richard Parsons, a senior lecturer in biochemical toxicology at King\u2019s College London, said. \u201cIt is only dangerous when it is about to be used, i.e. mixed together. It is unavailable from anywhere except the Russian military as far as I am aware.\u201d\n\nBritain charged two Russians -- alleged to be agents of the Russian military intelligence service GRU --- in absentia with the 2018 attack that left the Skripals in critical condition and killed a local woman. Russia has refused to extradite the men to the U.K.\n\nBritish police believe the nerve agent was smuggled to Britain in a counterfeit Nina Ricci perfume bottle and sprayed on the front door of Sergei Skripal\u2019s house in the city of Salisbury in southwest England.\n\nMore than three months later, the bottle was found by a local man, 48-year-old Charlie Rowley. He was hospitalized and his girlfriend, Dawn Sturgess, 44, died after being exposed to the contents.","title":"Germany says Soviet-era nerve agent used on Russian opposition leader Navalny","url":"http://en.setopati.com/political/153817","video":[]}
