The border checkpoint is to be opened after Nepali citizens retired from government and other service in India faced difficulties travelling to India to receive their pension due to its closure. Assistant Chief District Officer, Lokendra Singh Negi said the border transit would be opened from November 22 to 27 for facilitating the Nepali citizens to travel to India to receive their pension.\n\nThe checkpoint is to be opened for five days at the coordination of the District Administration Office Baitadi and DM Office, Pithouragadh, India. The Nepalis have not been able to travel to India to receive their pension as the border transit remained closed for long over the risk of coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAlthough it had been opened for three days before this, not all the Nepalis receiving pension from India had been able to go there to receive it. Assistant CDO Negi said people with emergency works can also cross the border through the checkpoint besides the pensioners during the period when the transit is open. It is said there are around 1,200 pensioners in Baitadi district receiving pension from India.","title":"Jhulaghat transit point to be opened for five days","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/16500","video":[]}
