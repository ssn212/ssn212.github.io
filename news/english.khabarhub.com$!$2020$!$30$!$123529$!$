However, the production is not on the full scale- only 9,000 sacks of cement are planned for everyday production.\n\nThe industry was not operated in full scale because of the prohibitory order imposed in various districts including the Kathmandu Valley and disruption on construction activities. The disruption of construction activities obviously affected the sales and distribution of the cement.\n\nSimilarly, a tender was issued for coal citing the possible shortage. In the first phase of the nationwide lockdown, the industry was however able to sell nearly half-million sacks of cement.\n\nThe industry was closed for a time and again due to machinery dysfunction last year. It resulted in a huge loss. It is said the industry spent a huge amount to repair the old machines.\n\nThe industry administration said investment cost was higher than the production because of old machines.\n\nRSS","title":"Hetauda Cement Industry resumes operation - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/30/123529/","video":[]}
