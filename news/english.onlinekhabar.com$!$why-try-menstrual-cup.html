When it came to my menstrual cycle, I knew that the traditional method of using pads was not sustainable in the long run.\n\nEach pad I used would sit in a landfill for years, and I could not help but feel guilty about my contribution to the environmental crisis. That is when my friends told me about menstrual cups. At first, I was sceptical and a little intimidated by the idea of using a menstrual cup instead of a pad. But after doing some research and hearing about the benefits from my friends, I decided to take the plunge and try it out for myself.\n\nFirst attempt: Overcoming my initial fears and concerns\n\nDuring the 2020 lockdown, I purchased a menstrual cup. However, my first attempt at using it on a non-period day resulted in discomfort and the fear of being unable to remove it. These negative experiences left me hesitant, and I stored the cup away for about three years.\n\nPhoto: Unsplash/ Inciclo\n\nRecently, a friend encouraged me to use the cup again during my period. This time, I was determined to succeed and regain control of the situation. Surprisingly, I felt no fear or nervousness. Although the first attempt caused some discomfort, it subsided after 15\u201320 minutes, and I was able to use it with ease. I barely felt the cup inside me, except for the typical menstrual cramps. The best part was feeling liberated from using pads.\n\nPeriod freedom: The amazing benefits of menstrual cups\n\nSwitching to a menstrual cup has numerous benefits, with one of the main advantages being that they only need to be changed every 8\u201312 hours, depending on the heaviness of your flow. I was amazed to see that the cup was only filled with 10 ml of blood for the entire day of my period. In contrast, if I had used pads, I would have needed to change them at least four times a day, making me feel like my flow was much heavier than it was.\n\nHowever, the main challenge with using a menstrual cup was to ensure that it did not leak. I decided to test it out by wearing white pants to a training session, and to my delight, it did not leak at all. The only time I experienced leakage was during the night when my flow was particularly heavy.\n\nOverall, I feel like switching to a menstrual cup was one of the best decisions I have made as it has many benefits:\n\nPad-free, rash-free period: Menstrual cups eliminate the need for bulky pads, preventing any potential rashes or discomfort caused by the adhesive on pads.\n\nFeels like non-period days, even during heavy period days: Using the cup offers a more natural feeling compared to pads, allowing for greater freedom of movement and a more comfortable experience.\n\nNo foul smell: The cup is made of medical-grade silicone or latex, preventing any unwanted odours that can come from using pads.\n\nEasy to do any sort of exercise or walk, dance freely: The flexibility of the cup allows for unrestricted movement, giving you the freedom to engage in any activities without worrying about discomfort.\n\nNo pad waste \u2013 giving back to the environment: Switching to the cup is a more sustainable choice, reducing your contribution to the waste generated by disposable pads.\n\nWho does not love saving money?\n\nPhoto: Pexels/ Cottonbro\n\nWith a menstrual cup, you can save your hard-earned money and invest it in something more worthwhile than buying pads every month. It is a one-time investment that will last you for years to come, and it is a lot cheaper in the long run compared to pads.\n\nSay goodbye to spending your precious money on overpriced pads and embrace the economical and eco-friendly menstrual cup, which starts from only Rs 500.\n\nImagine, only a Rs 500 investment for 10 years of happy and hassle-free periods, whereas each packet of pads costs around Rs 100, and we require at least two packets per month. That is a whopping Rs 24,000 for pads over 10 years. So, do not fall for the pink tax and switch to a menstrual cup today.\n\nMeanwhile, here is a list of must-know rules for happy cupping:\n\nThe right size matters : Choosing the right size ensures a comfortable fit and maximum protection against leaks, so take the time to find the perfect fit for you.\n\n: Choosing the right size ensures a comfortable fit and maximum protection against leaks, so take the time to find the perfect fit for you.

Not only am I helping the planet, but I am also enjoying a more comfortable and stress-free period. Although there might be a small learning curve, the incredible benefits are worth it.\n\nI urge anyone who wants to make a positive impact on their health and the environment to give menstrual cups a chance.\n\nLet every girl experience the freedom of a pad-free and hassle-free period because they deserve nothing but the best.
