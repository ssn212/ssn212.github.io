I no longer feel like giving it a political name,\u201d he expressed sarcasm over NC.\n\nIn light of the grave circumstances the country is currently facing, Chairman Oli stated that the Nepali Congress, despite its long history, has become neglectful and inactive.\n\nHe stated that the Nepali Congress has lost its sense of direction and is uncertain about its future course.\n\nUML Chairman Oli further stated that the CPN-UML will not compromise its principles for the sake of acquiring power or forming a government with any other political party.\n\nAccusing the current coalition of being without a clear objective, he asserted that the absence of progress, instability, and chaos in the country can be attributed to the power-sharing alliance.\n\n\u201cThe situation has deteriorated to such an extent that whether the government will continue or collapse remains uncertain,\u201d Oli said adding, \u201cRecently, I conveyed to the Prime Minister that once a frog is swallowed by a snake, even if a shrimp appears, the snake will extend its tongue to devour it.\u201d\n\nThe incumbent government led by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal \u201cPrachanda\u201d resembles such a scenario, as it finds itself surrounded by crises and on the verge of being consumed by multiple challenges.\n\nHowever, the government seems oblivious to its precarious situation, he said.","title":"Govt seems oblivious to its precarious situation: Oli","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/17/304119/","video":[]}
