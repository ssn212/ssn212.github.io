That\u2019s double the figure from 2021, the last time the survey was taken.\n\n\u201cIn particular, majorities in Denmark [74%] Poland [71%], Sweden [70%], the Netherlands [66%], Germany [62%] and Spain [55%], think of Russia as an \u201cadversary\u201d of Europe \u2013 while only 37% in Italy and 17% in Bulgaria do,\u201d the ECFR report said.\n\nFuture relations\n\nThe respondents also were asked about Europe\u2019s future relationship with Moscow.\n\n\u201cAround half of those surveyed [48%] believe their country\u2019s relationship with Russia, in the event of a negotiated peace settlement in Ukraine, should be \u2018limited,\u2019\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cThe only country where a majority [51%] of citizens expressed the view that it should be \u2018fully cooperative\u2019 was Bulgaria. Many in Austria [36%] and Hungary [32%] also supported this view,\u201d it added.\n\nEuropean Security\n\nThe survey looked at attitudes toward the security guarantees provided by the United States and whether Europe should invest more in its own defense. Some EU leaders \u2013 notably French President Emmanuel Macron \u2013 have called for Europe to develop strategic autonomy, the ability to defend itself independent of the U.S.\n\nAlmost three-quarters of the respondents said Europe cannot always rely on the U.S. for its security.\n\n\u201cYou can interpret it, of course, as a sign that Europeans are not trusting Americans that much as they used to historically. And in this sense, perhaps the presidency of Donald Trump has left lasting damage to that relationship,\u201d said Pawel Zerka, a co-author of the report with the European Council on Foreign Relations, in an interview with VOA.\n\n\u201cBut you can also have a more benevolent interpretation, according to which \u2013 simply due to the war in Ukraine and Russia\u2019s invasion on Ukraine \u2013 Europeans are more ready right now to take responsibility for their security,\u201d he said.\n\nChina\u2019s position\n\nThe survey asked similar questions about European attitudes toward China.\n\n\u201cA plurality of respondents [43%] consider China a \u201cnecessary partner\u201d of their country. This position puts them closer to the political positions of Germany\u2019s Olaf Scholz and France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron than China hawks, such as [European Union Commission President] Ursula von der Leyen,\u201d the report said.\n\nCo-author Pawel Zerka said that compared to Russia, there are marked differences in European attitudes toward China.\n\n\u201cPeople mostly say that the risks and benefits are balanced, so they do not recognize that economic relationship with China as particularly risky and therefore requiring some rebalancing,\u201d he told VOA.\n\nHowever, a majority of Europeans opposed the idea of Chinese ownership of key infrastructure, while 41% of respondents said that if Beijing gave weapons to Russia, the EU should impose sanctions on Beijing even if that would harm Western economies.\n\n(VOA)","title":"Most Europeans see Russia as an adversary: Poll","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/01/309144/","video":[]}
