It has since launched more than 5,000 Starlinks from Florida and California, using its own Falcon rockets.\n\nEurope\u2019s Eutelsat OneWeb also is launching internet satellites, with around 600 in orbit.\n\nAmazon originally agreed to put the satellites on the debut launch of ULA\u2019s Vulcan rocket. But with the Vulcan grounded by problems until at least the end of this year, Amazon switched to the long-established Atlas V.\n\nWhen licensing the program, the Federal Communications Commission stipulated that at least half of the planned satellites be operating by 2026 and all of them by 2029.\n\nAmazon has reserved 77 launches from ULA, Blue Origin and Europe\u2019s Arianespace to get everything up and orbiting before the deadline.\n\n(AP/VOA)","title":"Amazon launches test satellites, plans internet service competing with SpaceX","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/07/321289/","video":[]}
