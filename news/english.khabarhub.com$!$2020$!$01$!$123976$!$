He has at times taken a jibe at the opposition party leadership saying NC is giving lessons of nationalism to him.\n\nSeveral political experts, and Nepal Communist Party lawmakers, too, criticize NC of breathing its last.\n\nConsider what political analyst Puranjan Acharya says: \u201cNepal political parties are better in terms of internal democracy in comparison to other political parties in South Asia. However, NC is currently faltering in Deuba\u2019s leadership as there have been instances of violating the party statute at times.\u201d\n\nHe referred to Deuba\u2019s recent \u201cunilateral\u201d appointments in various party departments indicating the lack of internal democracy. Acharya, however, has a question: \u201cWhat is the measuring rod for internal democracy?\u201d\n\nObservers, including some NC insiders, too, complain that nepotism has overshadowed the party\u2019s nationalism.\n\nNC has also been criticized for depletion and having a skeletal representation in the parliament as weak opposition in a democratic country will have serious implications as the Oli-led government seems confident about holding on to the power irrespective of all wrongs.\n\nPolitical pundits say NC lacks stamina or comprehensive strategy to take in the NCP\u2019s power duo to Prime Minister KP Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal.\n\n\u201cIf NC wishes to survive, it needs to reinvent itself from the grassroots,\u201d claims Arun Subedi, political analyst, adding that Nepali Congress now needs to promote internal democracy and political vitality.\n\nHere, the worst part is that people are displeased with PM Oli, unhappy with the economy, unhappy with the way the government is combating the COVID-19 pandemic, and unhappy with the way the government has indulged in corruption.\n\n\u201cHowever, people do not see NC as a viable alternative,\u201d added Subedi.\n\n\u201cPeople now do not want to vote for the same old traditional NC party, they want youths to step in to break the trend of nepotism,\u201d he says adding, \u201cIf this does not happen, the NC party which boasts of a celebrated history with a crucial role in fighting against the Ranas, monarchs, and autocracy, faces the prospect of extinction.\u201d\n\nObservers say Nepal needs a strong opposition with a distinct alternative political vision to the NCP.\n\nFreeing the party apparatus from the current power structure of nepotism and unilateralism is the need of the hour, analysts say.\n\nSubedi adds it is high time that the NC party trod on the path of BP Koirala by completely deserting the Communist ideology, which it has been following for the last seven years. \u201cOr else it will be confined within the four walls,\u201d he warns.\n\nNC influential leader Gagan Thapa, too, is worried about the performance of the current leadership of the party. \u201cThe party\u2019s general convention is the yardstick to measure the internal democracy,\u201d he says indicating at the leadership\u2019s reluctance to hold the same.\n\n\u201cIf the party fails to exhibit internal democracy, the party\u2019s future will be at stake,\u201d he warns.\n\nFreeing the party apparatus from the current power structure of nepotism and unilateralism is the need of the hour, analysts say.\n\nConsider what Thapa has to say, \u201cVital is to re-evaluate what the party stands for as NC badly needs a positive and forward-looking leadership and platform.\u201d\n\nParty senior leader Ram Chandra Poudel, too, is disgruntled with Deuba and his \u201cunilateral\u201d moves, which he has been reiterating that such steps will push the party to the brink of extinction.\n\nIf Subedi\u2019s views are anything to go by, NC needs to stop following the communist way of thinking and act more like a democratic party.","title":"Isn't it time for Nepali Congress to reinvent itself? - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/01/123976/","video":[]}
