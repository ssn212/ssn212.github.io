(Photo: AFP)\n\nKAOHSIUNG, TAIWAN: The billionaire founder of Foxconn vowed Sunday at a rally that if elected president of Taiwan, he would be able to \u201cpreserve peace\u201d between the democratic self-ruled island and China.\n\nTaiwan will elect its next leader in January 2024 to succeed President Tsai Ing-wen, whose two terms in power have been marked by unprecedented tensions with Beijing, which views the island as part of its territory to be reclaimed.\n\nTerry Gou \u2014 the founder of Foxconn which is a key supplier of Apple\u2019s iPhones \u2014 had announced in April he planned to seek the presidential nomination of Taiwan\u2019s China-friendly opposition Kuomintang party.\n\nDuring his first-ever rally, in Taiwan\u2019s southern city of Kaohsiung \u2014 traditionally a stronghold of Tsai\u2019s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) \u2014 Gou urged his supporters to \u201clet me preserve peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last two years, what I have seen is a government who cannot see the sufferings of the people,\u201d the 72-year-old said in a speech to a sea of more than 10,000 supporters. \u201cWhat do the people worry about the most now? They are most concerned that war will break out anytime.\u201d\n\nGou \u2014 who donned a cap with Taiwan\u2019s flag \u2014 said he can \u201cdo better than Tsai Ing-wen, or William Lai,\u201d the current Taiwanese vice president who has been nominated as the DPP\u2019s candidate.\n\n\u201cLet me, on behalf of everyone, strive for peace. Let me preserve the peace,\u201d he said.\n\nThis would not be Gou\u2019s first bid at political leadership \u2014 he attempted a run in 2019 before the previous election but lost to populist outsider Han Kuo-yu for the KMT\u2019s nomination.\n\nGou\u2019s self-made tale is legendary in Taiwan and mimics the island\u2019s phenomenal economic success.\n\nBut the huge factories built in China under Gou have rattled critics over his perceived coziness with Beijing\u2019s leadership.\n\nIn this photo provided Nov 23, 2022, protesters face off against security personnel in white protective clothing at the factory compound operated by Foxconn Technology Group who runs the world\u2019s biggest Apple iPhone factory in Zhengzhou in central China\u2019s Henan province.\n\nThe KMT tends to advocate warmer ties with China while under Tsai\u2019s leadership, relations with Beijing have plummeted.\n\nDemocratic Taiwan lives under constant threat of invasion by China, which views the island as part of its territory to be reclaimed one day, by force, if necessary.\n\nChina has ramped up its saber-rattling in recent years, sending warplanes near-daily into Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone.\n\nLast month, it conducted its latest war games around the island in response to a meeting between Tsai and U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California.\n\nVOA","title":"Foxconn Founder vows to \u2018preserve peace\u2019 with China if elected Taiwan President","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/08/303196/","video":[]}
