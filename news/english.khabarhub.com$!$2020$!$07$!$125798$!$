Around 1,250 hotels operated at different places in the district, including Sauraha and other sites are closed for almost six months now.\n\nBishow Subedi, a tourism sector researcher, said 225 tourist hotels in the district and almost 50 percent of such hotels are in Sauraha. He further said that there are 29 tourist hotels in Ratnanagar area and 65 in Bharatpur Metropolitan City.\n\nThe tourist hotels used to make a transaction of Rs 10.5 million every day in tourist season, while other hotels were also used to create an almost equal amount of transactions.\n\nHotel entrepreneurs said that their regular income from additional touristic activities, including jeep safari, boat safari and elephant safari, was around three million.\n\nA study shows that 16,000 workers are working in hotels and restaurants in the district and more than 30 billion have been invested in this sector.\n\nChairperson of the Regional Hotel association in Sauraha Chapter, Deepak Bhattarai, said that we have hoped more domestic tourists flow in Chitwan district during the Dashain festival. \u201cBut, now we have lost our hope due to coronavirus pandemic,\u201d he added.\n\nLikewise, outgoing President Chairman of Regional Hotel Association Suman Ghimire said that the hoteliers would bear huge losses if they resume their business until the favorable environment was fully restored.\n\nHe said that both the businesspersons and laborers were on the same boat during this sorry state. \u201cAll the laborers are laid off. Their daily life is severely affected,\u201d Ghimire added.
