NGM Hero, the authorized distributors of the Hero motorcycles in Nepal, has announced the launch of the new Hero Super Splendor.\n\nIt is a new update to one of the best-selling Hero motorcycles in Nepal. The new Super Splendor 125 comes with a refined i3s engine, high-mileage performance, and new enhanced safety features.\n\nHowever, the overall design and features remain unchanged.\n\nWe are delighted to launch the Super Splendor with IBS for our customers in Nepal. The Super Splendor is one of the most popular motorcycles in the country and we are certain this sentiment and trust on the brand will only grow for this motorcycle, which is now safer than before.\u201d, says Mr. Rajat Bhargava, Head at Global Business.\n\nWith that said, let\u2019s take a quick look at the new Hero Super Splendor 125 in Nepal.\n\nHero Super Splendor 125 Specifications Engine Type: Air Cooled, 4 \u2013 Stroke cylinder OHC, Self Start\n\nAir Cooled, 4 \u2013 Stroke cylinder OHC, Self Start Displacement: 124.7 cc\n\n124.7 cc Cooling System: Air Cooled\n\nAir Cooled Starting Mechanism: Self Starter and Kick Start\n\nSelf Starter and Kick Start Max Power: 9.0 bhp @ 7000 rpm\n\n9.0 bhp @ 7000 rpm Max Torque: 10.35 Nm @ 4000 rpm\n\n10.35 Nm @ 4000 rpm Gearbox: 4-Speed\n\n4-Speed Top Speed: 90 Kmph\n\n90 Kmph Fuel Tank Capacity: 13 liter\n\n13 liter Mileage: 50-60 kmpl\n\n50-60 kmpl Front Tyre: 2.75 x 18 \u2013 Drum\n\n2.75 x 18 \u2013 Drum Rear Tyre: 3.00 x 18 \u2013 Drum\n\n3.00 x 18 \u2013 Drum Tubeless Tyres: Yes\n\nYes Braking System: Integrated Braking System (IBS)\n\nIntegrated Braking System (IBS) Suspension Setup: Telescopic Front and Adjustable Rear Hydraulic Shock\n\nTelescopic Front and Adjustable Rear Hydraulic Shock Seat Height: 785 mm\n\n785 mm Ground Clearance: 150 mm\n\n150 mm Kerb Weight: 123 kg\n\n123 kg Colors: Candy Blazing Red, Black with Red Stripes, Black with Grey, Black with Violet Stripes, and Ebony Grey. Hero Super Splendor 125 Price in Nepal: Rs. 1,98,000\n\nHero Super Splendor 125 Overview\n\nDesign\n\nSuper Splendor is designed and developed at the Hero MotoCorp R&D center in Jaipur India.\n\nAs stated earlier, the overall design hasn\u2019t changed much.\n\nThe new Super Splendor still gets the classic design with a slightly fancier styling. Compared to the other Hero motorcycles, Super Splendor is supposed to be a more premium offering.\n\nIn hindsight, it sports a bulkier body, complete with a unique styling along with modern graphics.\n\nAll in all, you get what you see.\n\nHero Super Splendor is available in five premium colors: Candy Blazing Red, Black with Red Stripes, Black with Grey, Black with Violet Stripes, and Ebony Grey.\n\nALSO READ: KTM Duke 200 BS6 Pre-Booking Opens in Nepal: What\u2019s New in BS6 Version?\n\nPerformance\n\nHero Super Splendor still comes with a BS4-compliant engine.\n\nIt is powered by a 124.7cc air-cooled, 4-stroke, single-cylinder engine. Moreover, it can generate a max power of 9.0bhp at 7000rpm and max torque of 10.35Nm at 4000rpm. Furthermore, it is mated to a 4-speed gearbox.\n\nHero Super Splendor 125 claims a top speed of 90 Km/h and an average 50-60kmpl mileage with a 13-liter fuel tank.\n\nOther than that, the rest of the Super Splendor remains unchanged.\n\nIt is still built on the Tubular Double Cradle Type with front Telescopic Hydraulic Shock Absorbers and rear Hydraulic Shock Absorber.\n\nALSO READ: TVS Apache RTR 160 4V Available in New Variant: Now More Affordable!\n\nFeatures\n\nHero claims the new Super Splendor 125 as their premium offerings. Taking a quick look at the features, they resonate with the same sentiment.\n\nHero Super Splendor 125 Feature Highlights\n\nNew Integrated Braking System (IBS)\n\nSelf-Start Feature\n\nI3S Technology\n\nSide Stand Indicator\n\n18-inch Alloy Wheels\n\nMassive 13-liters Fuel Tank\n\nAdditional Storage Utility Box\n\nDual Drum Brakes\n\nHero Super Splendor 125 Price in Nepal and Availability\n\nAs stated earlier, Hero claims Super Splendor 125 to be a more premium offering. Compared with other Hero bikes, this is true.\n\nHero Super Splendor 125 price in Nepal is Rs. 1,98,000, and is now available across all Hero Showrooms in Nepal.\n\nIt is still one of the most affordable 125cc bikes against the competition like Honda Shine, Yamaha Saluto, TVS Stryker, and Suzuki Hayate.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the relatively affordable price tag comes at a cost. Instead of a traditional front disc and rear drum braking option, Hero opted for a drum only version.\n\nI do think it might affect real-world braking performance. Fortunately, Super Splendor has included an Integrated Braking System (IBS). IBS works like any other braking system where the system distributes braking force equally to both the front and rear wheel.\n\nAs for the competition, Hero Super Splendor 125 goes all out against Honda Shine 125. Both bikes feature a similar engine and similar performance. So, the real-world usage might not differ all that much.\n\nHowever, Honda Shine comes with a 5-speed gearbox, which assists in higher speed. In contrast, Hero Super Splendor 125 is far more affordable with solid build quality.\n\nPlus, Hero MotoCorp is offering 30% discounts in engine oil, a 7% discount in spare parts, a 5-year warranty, and a FREE helmet.\n\nAlso, watch our Suzuki Gixxer 250 Review in Nepali!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWho are authorized distributors of Hero Motorcycles in Nepal?\n\nNGM Hero is the authorized distributor of the Hero motorcycles in Nepal.\n\nWhat is the price of Hero Super Splendor in Nepal?\n\nHero Super Splendor 125 price in Nepal is Rs. 1,98,000.\n\nAre Hero bikes reliable?\n\nHero bikes offer the best value for money for commuters looking for a good motorcycle with good performance and excellent mileage.
