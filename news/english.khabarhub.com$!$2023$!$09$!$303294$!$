Nine million can access all forms of education. They include girls up to grade six. Around 300,000 teachers, including 92,000 females, teach in these institutions,\u201d he said.\n\nThe hardline Islamist group reclaimed control of the country in August 2021 when the United States and NATO withdrew their troops after almost two decades of involvement in the Afghan war. The Taliban have since imposed their strict version of Islamic law or Sharia to run the impoverished, war-torn South Asian nation.\n\nMany Afghan women, including those working for the United Nations and non-governmental groups, have been blocked from accessing work and public places.\n\nThe Taliban have rejected international demands to remove restrictions on women as interference in Afghanistan\u2019s internal affairs.\n\nStill in his remarks Monday, Muttaqi insisted that thousands of female doctors and nurses are working in health business sectors. Girls and women are attending madrasas (Islamic seminaries) and even teaching there.\n\n\u201cWe have never said that female education is un-Islamic or banned permanently in Afghanistan. The decree clearly stated that female education is suspended until further notice,\u201d Muttaqi said.\n\nHe referred to the edict issued by the reclusive Taliban chief, Hibatullah Akhundzada, last year that prohibited young girls from attending schools beyond the sixth grade and subsequently suspended female students from accessing university classes.\n\n\u201cWe have made progress on this issue to a large extent, and the government of Afghanistan will continue to make efforts to resolve the remaining problems about this issue amicably,\u201d Muttaqi said without elaborating.\n\nA team of U.N. experts on human rights concluded an eight-day mission to the country last Friday, reporting an unprecedented \u201cextreme situation of institutionalized gender-based discrimination\u201d in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned about the apparent perpetration in Afghanistan of gender persecution \u2014 a systematic and grave human rights violation and a crime against humanity,\u201d the mission said in its preliminary findings. It noted Taliban authorities, in meetings with the U.N. team, had reiterated that they were working on the reopening of girls\u2019 schools but did not provide a clear timeline.\n\nTrilateral talks\n\nMuttaqi, who faces U.N. travel sanctions, was given a waiver to make the visit to Islamabad to attend on Saturday a trilateral meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang and Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.\n\nBeijing and Islamabad urged the Taliban delegation to conduct counterterror actions against terrorist groups operating on Afghan soil and threatening regional security.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow anyone to use the soil of Afghanistan against others. We have been successful in our resolve, and we will remain committed to this pledge in the future that Afghan soil is not used against anyone,\u201d responded Muttaqi while speaking at Monday\u2019s seminar in the Pakistani capital.\n\nPakistan issued a joint statement Monday about the three-nation talks, saying the participants resolved to deepen and expand their cooperation in the security, development, and political domains.\n\nThey also stressed the need for the Taliban to stop militant groups, including the outlawed Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP and the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement, or ETIM, from using Afghan soil to threaten neighboring countries.\n\nTTP and ETIM have been waging deadly attacks, respectively, in Pakistan and China from their alleged sanctuaries in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Chinese and Pakistani delegates agreed at the meeting to enhance support for the Taliban government in the economic reconstruction of the war-torn country.\n\nThe joint statement said the three countries reaffirmed \u201ctheir commitment to further the trilateral cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and to jointly extend the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nThe CPEC is a multibillion-dollar extension to Pakistan of China\u2019s global BRI infrastructure development project.\n\nChinese investment of more than $20 billion has built new roads, power plants, and ports in Pakistan to help improve its economy, linking the two allied nations through the corridor to give China access to international markets through the Arabian Sea deep-water Pakistani port of Gwadar.\n\nThe Chinese-developed and run port is expected to further facilitate trade and transit activities to and through landlocked Afghanistan to Central Asian countries.\n\nVOA","title":"Taliban diplomat defends policies, insists Afghan women education ban not \u2018permanent\u2019","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/09/303294/","video":[]}
