Disgruntled locals locked up the rural municipality on Sunday evening following the transfer of ward no. 3 office to Fisling amidst dispute. The ward office had been operational from the office of rural municipality when even the municipal assembly failed to fix the issue.\n\nThere was a persisting debate whether to keep the ward-3 office at Cumlingtar or Fisling. It was not finalized in lack of clear majority on the proposal of the ward chair in the municipal assembly. Ward chair Gobardhan Adhikari had proposed to place the office at Fisling while ward member Dil Bahadur Chepang proposed to keep it at Chumlingtar. Shiva Poudel, a discontent local, accused the rural municipality leadership of shifting the ward office to Fisling in a coveted manner when lockdown against coronavirus spread was in place.\n\nHe shared the locals padlocked the office to exert pressure on reverting the decision of transferring the ward office from Chumlingtar. He also warned that the lock would not be lifted until the dispute was resolved. However, ward-3 chair Adhikari clarified that the office was temporarily shifted to a local club building in Fisling till the dispute is fixed. Adhikari urged the locals not to come up with aggression on the issue as it would be permanently resolved through next municipal assembly.","title":"Office of Ichhakamana rural municipality padlocked","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/14997","video":[]}
