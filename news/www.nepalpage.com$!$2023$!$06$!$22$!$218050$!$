Various levels of leaders were involved in the campaign to mobilize inactive workers.\n\nAccording to the internal party directive sent to the lower level, UML received applications for membership from 1,196,096 individuals. This indicates that the party expects an increase in the number of its members.\n\nHowever, there has been a significant decline in UML\u2019s membership numbers. Many existing party members have not shown interest in renewing their membership.\n\nAccording to a letter sent by President K.P. Sharma Oli to the lower committee, only 40% of the total existing members in Party have renewed their membership.\n\nThe exact total number is not mentioned in the report. However, according to public data available before the 10th National Convention held in Chitwan on Kartik 25, 2078 (November 11, 2021), UML\u2019s had 850,000 organized members.\n\nIn the seventh point of the letter, it is stated, \u201cWith 40% renewal in the mission\u2019s important objective of renewing party membership, removing names and details of individuals who have died, doubled, or are in inactive status or have left the party, and taking forward the process of new membership applications is expected to increase this number when the final details are prepared.\u201d\n\nHowever, even in the first week of Asar (mid-June), the number of renewals is significantly low. Party\u2019s permanent committee member and head of the publicity department, Rajendra Gautam, acknowledged the decrease in the renewal count.\n\n\u201cDuring the unification between the Maoist Centre and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), there were 800,000 members. It seems that the number has decreased due to the increase in Maoist Centre\u2019s membership,\u201d Gautam said in an interview with Nepalpage \u201cWe have witnessed a decrease in the renewal count.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, at that time,Party had 500,000 members, and the Maoist Centre had 300,000 members, making a total of 800,000 members.\n\n\u201cIn the merger, it was around a 60:40 ratio, but after the Maoist Centre separated, it decreased naturally,\u201d Gautam added.\n\nRegarding why Party showed 800,000 members at the tenth convention, Gautam couldn\u2019t provide an answer to that question.\n\nHe only mentioned that the number presented during the unification process was different from the number of renewals.\n\nOn the 23rd of Falgun, 2077, there was a split in the Nepal Communist Party. The National Mahasammelan (General Convention) of the CPN (Unified Marxist-Leninist) was held in Chitwan from the 11th to the 18th of Mangsir, 2078.\n\n\u201cIncreasing the number in the party alone is not enough; the quality of the members must also increase. Therefore, if the number of members increases, it should be accompanied by a decrease in the number of inactive members,\u201d said Gautam, the Chief of the Publicity Department.\n\nAccording to Gautam\u2019s statement, the number of members in the CPN (UML) was only 500,000. Even though 119,000 applications were received during the two-month recruitment campaign, the actual increase in the number of active members was significantly less, as many existing members did not renew their membership. Sher Bahadur Tamang, a member of the Standing Committee, demands an increase in the number of members until Asar 15.\n\n\u201cSo far, only 56% of the renewal has been done,\u201d Tamang said, \u201cEven though the deadline for renewal was set until Asar 15, it has been extended, and the number will increase further.\u201d\n\n\u201cPreviously, when one person confirmed everyone\u2019s list, the provision of renewal was removed to ensure personal presence. It was also mentioned that even for the representation in the \u2018Mahasammelan\u2019, there were enough numbers. However, after that provision was removed, it is observed that the number has significantly decreased,\u201d Tamang explained the reason for the decrease in renewals.\n\nAn official from the CPN (UML) revealed that only half of the renewals have been completed so far.\n\n\u201cRenewal should reach 50%,\u201d the official said, \u201cNo program has been initiated that can have an impact at the grassroots level. It is not seen that the party has gained attraction when not in power.\u201d\n\nSher Bahadur Tamang, a member of the Standing Committee, also explains it from a political psychology perspective.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who forms the government; what matters is whether people are attracted or not,\u201d Tamang said.\n\nAfter the results of the representative and provincial assembly elections held on November 21, 2022 did not meet expectations, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) has focused on strengthening the organization. It has removed leaders from various districts and non-geographical areas, making them full-time members.\n\nThe decrease in renewal can be attributed to various reasons. Rajendra Gautam, the head of the Publicity Department, claimed that the plan to reduce the number of party members is still in progress.\n\n\u201cWe want to maintain a qualitative number along with increasing the number,\u201d he said. \u201cCategorization of active individuals in the party is necessary.\u201d\n\nEven those who joined the CPN (Maoist Centre) after the election in Mangsir have been discussing the issue of non-renewal of membership.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t leave; they might have gone somewhere,\u201d said Sher Bahadur Tamang, a member of the Standing Committee. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel their absence has any impact. However, there is a difference in the organized membership of the CPN (Maoist Centre). It is a party based on mass, not just a party with a base in the urban areas.\u201d\n\nLeaders and activists of the CPN (Maoist Centre) have emerged from districts like Chitwan, Tanahu, Kathmandu, and Lalitpur.\n\nThe name of not renewing membership should be kept confidential.","title":"Why haven\u2019t UML\u2019s lower-level workers renewed their membership?","url":"http://www.nepalpage.com/2023/06/22/218050/","video":[]}
