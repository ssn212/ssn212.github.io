The DST aims to ensure that these e-businesses pay their fair share of taxes in Nepal and contribute to the country\u2019s development. You can read Procedure relating to Digital Service Tax, 2079 (2022) on the IRD website here.\n\nA total of nine electronic service companies had registered in Nepal after the Digital Service Tax came into effect. Out of these nine companies, six have started paying taxes.\n\nThe following six companies have paid Digital Service Tax to Nepal government:\n\nGoogle Asia Pacific Private Limited (Singapore) Google Ireland Limited (Dublin, Ireland) LinkedIn Singapore Private Limited (Singapore) Amazon.com Services LLC Amazon Web Services Incorporation Limited NCS Pearson Inc Limited\n\nHowever, the following three companies are registered in Nepal but have not paid taxes to Nepal government:\n\nMeta Platforms Ireland Ltd (Dublin, Ireland) Microsoft Regional Sales Pvt Ltd (Singapore) Ibsco International Incorporated (Wilmington, County of Newcastle)\n\nWe have prepared this table to make it easier for you to grasp the information.\n\nCompany Name Location Status Google Asia Pacific Private Limited Singapore Registered & Paid Google Ireland Limited Dublin, Ireland Registered & Paid LinkedIn Singapore Private Limited Singapore Registered & Paid Amazon.com Services LLC USA Registered & Paid Amazon Web Services Incorporation Limited USA Registered & Paid NCS Pearson Inc Limited USA Registered & Paid Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd Dublin, Ireland Registered Microsoft Regional Sales Pvt Ltd Singapore Registered Ibsco International Incorporated USA Registered Platforms that are registered in Nepal, and those that have started paying taxes\n\nDigital Service Tax was introduced in the Financial Act last year to make e-businesses pay their fair share of taxes in Nepal. As a result, digital service providers in Nepal had to register with the tax system.\n\nAccording to the tax law, e-businesses that provide services to Nepali consumers have to pay 2% of the value of their transactions as DST. However, transactions below Rs 2 million per year are exempt from this tax. The law also has penalties for those who don\u2019t pay the DST.\n\nWhile the tax has worked well for some companies, but many others are still dodging the tax system. In fact, many non-resident companies are yet to be registered with the Large Taxpayer Office.\n\nThis is a problem because various government studies have shown that the government is losing a lot of revenue because of e-businesses that are not in the tax system, including social networks that are very popular in Nepal.\n\n(With inputs from RSS)","title":"Nepal Collects Rs 100 Million In Digital Service Tax","url":"http://techsathi.com/nepal-collects-100-million-digital-service-tax-google-linkedin","video":[]}
