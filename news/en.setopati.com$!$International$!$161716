Additionally, 153 injured people were sent to hospitals for treatment. The ministry wrote that most damage occurred outside of cities and towns.\n\nThe head of the town of Talat N\u2019Yaaqoub, Abderrahim Ait Daoud, told Moroccan news site 2M that several homes in towns in the Al Haouz region had partly or totally collapsed, and electricity and roads were cut off in some places.\n\nHe said authorities are working to clear roads in the province to allow passage for ambulances and aid to populations affected, but said large distances between mountain villages mean it will take time to learn the extent of the damage.\n\nMoroccans posted videos showing buildings reduced to rubble and dust, and parts of the famous red walls that surround the old city in Marrakech, a UNESCO World Heritage site, damaged. Tourists and others posted videos of people screaming and evacuating restaurants in the city as throbbing club music played.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.8 when it hit at 11:11 p.m. (2211 GMT), with shaking that lasted several seconds. The U.S. agency reported a magnitude-4.9 aftershock hit 19 minutes later.\n\nThe USGS said the epicenter was 18 kilometers (11 miles) below the Earth\u2019s surface, while Morocco\u2019s seismic agency put it at 8 kilometers (5 miles) down. In either case, such shallow quakes are more dangerous.\n\nThe epicenter of Friday\u2019s tremor was high in the Atlas Mountains, roughly 70 kilometers (43.5 miles) south of Marrakech. It was also near Toubkal, the highest peak in North Africa and Oukaimeden, a popular Moroccan ski resort.\n\nEarthquakes are relatively rare in North Africa. Lahcen Mhanni, Head of the Seismic Monitoring and Warning Department at the National Institute of Geophysics, told 2M TV that the earthquake was \u201cexceptional.\u201d\n\n\u201cMountainous regions in general do not produce earthquakes of this size,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the strongest earthquake recorded in the region.\u201d\n\nIn 1960, a magnitude 5.8 tremor struck near the Moroccan city of Agadir and caused thousands of deaths.\n\nThe Agadir quake prompted changes in construction rules in Morocco, but many buildings, especially rural homes, are not built to withstand such tremors.\n\nFriday\u2019s quake was felt as far away as Portugal and Algeria, according to the Portuguese Institute for Sea and Atmosphere and Algeria\u2019s Civil Defense agency, which oversees emergency response.","title":"Powerful earthquake strikes Morocco, killing hundreds and damaging historic buildings in Marrakech","url":"http://en.setopati.com/International/161716","video":[]}
