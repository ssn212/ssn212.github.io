Washington will send man-portable air defense systems, or MANPADS, intelligence and surveillance capabilities, firearms and missiles, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters ahead of the announcement.\n\nU.S. lawmakers have been pressuring the Pentagon and White House to speed weapons to Taiwan. The goals are to help it counter China and to deter China from considering attacking, by providing Taipei enough weaponry that it would make the price of invasion too high.\n\nWhile Chinese diplomats protested the move, Taiwan\u2019s trade office in Washington said the U.S. decision to pull arms and other materiel from its stores provided \u201can important tool to support Taiwan\u2019s self-defense.\u201d In a statement, it pledged to work with the United States to maintain \u201cpeace, stability and the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.\u201d\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of National Defense also expressed its appreciation in a statement Saturday morning that thanked \u201cthe U.S. for its firm commitment to Taiwan\u2019s security.\u201d\n\nThe package is in addition to nearly $19 billion in military sales of F-16s and other major weapons systems that the U.S. has approved for Taiwan. Delivery of those weapons has been hampered by supply chain issues that started during the COVID-19 pandemic and have been exacerbated by the global defense industrial base pressures created by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe difference is that this aid is part of a presidential authority approved by Congress last year to draw weapons from current U.S. military stockpiles \u2014 so Taiwan will not have to wait for military production and sales. This gets weapons delivered faster than providing funding for new weapons.\n\nThe Pentagon has used a similar authority to get billions of dollars worth of munitions to Ukraine.\n\nTaiwan split from China in 1949 amid civil war. Chinese President Xi Jinping maintains China\u2019s right to take over the now self-ruled island, by force if necessary. China has accused the U.S. of turning Taiwan into a \u201cpowder keg\u201d through the billions of dollars in weapons sales it has pledged.\n\nThe U.S. maintains a \u201cOne China\u201d policy under which it does not recognize Taiwan\u2019s as an independent country and has no formal diplomatic relations with the island in deference to Beijing. However, U.S. law requires a credible defense for Taiwan and for the U.S. to treat all threats to the island as matters of \u201cgrave concern.\u201d\n\nGetting stockpiles of weapons to Taiwan now, before an attack begins, is one of the lessons the U.S. has learned from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Pentagon deputy defense secretary Kathleen Hicks told The Associated Press earlier this year.\n\nUkraine \u201cwas more of a cold-start approach than the planned approach we have been working on for Taiwan, and we will apply those lessons,\u201d Hicks said. Efforts to resupply Taiwan after a conflict erupted would be complicated because it is an island, she said.\n\nChina regularly sends warships and planes across the center line in the Taiwan Strait that provides a buffer between the sides, as well as into Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone, in an effort to intimidate the island\u2019s 23 million people and wear down its military capabilities.\n\nLiu Pengyu, a spokesman for China\u2019s embassy in Washington, said in a statement Friday that Beijing was \u201cfirmly opposed\u201d to U.S. military ties with Taiwan. The U.S. should \u201cstop selling arms to Taiwan\u201d and \u201cstop creating new factors that could lead to tensions in the Taiwan Strait,\u201d Liu said.","title":"US announces $345 million military aid package for Taiwan","url":"http://en.setopati.com/International/161469","video":[]}
