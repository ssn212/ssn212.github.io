They arrived from 16 high-risk areas in Israel, travelling to the capital, Tel Aviv, and were subsequently brought to Kathmandu via Nepal Airlines flight RA-230.\n\nForeign Minister NP Saud, who also serves as the coordinator of the government-formed coordination mechanism, departed for Tel Aviv on the morning of October 11 for rescue efforts. After successfully repatriating 254 individuals on the sixth day following the incident, Foreign Minister Saud announced that the rescue operation would continue as more Nepalis needed to be brought back from the conflict zone.\n\nStating that the Council of Ministers has approved covering the ticket expenses for those arriving on commercial flights, he said aircraft would be dispatched as required for the repatriation of Nepalis from Israel.\n\nIn the initial phase of rescue, the majority of those saved were students who went to Israel under the \u2018Learn and Earn\u2019 programme. A total of 265 students, studying agriculture at Tribhuvan University, Far Western University, and Agriculture and Forestry University, had travelled to Israel under this initiative. Tragically, 10 of them lost their lives in an attack by Hamas, four sustained injuries, and one remains missing.\n\nThe government, however, has not brought back the bodies of the deceased as it is yet to be released by the Israeli government. The Foreign Ministry has said their remains will be brought back soon. But those who have returned have called on the government to bring back all Nepali stranded in Nepal soon.\n\nLucky escape\n\nShoba Paswan of Rampur Campus, Chitwan, is one among the 265 students who went to Israel under the Learn and Earn Programme. After landing at TIA on October 13, she told Onlinekhabar how scary the situation was in Israel and how lucky she and others were to make it out alive.\n\n\u201cWe were in the bunker for 24 hours on Saturday (October 7). We were so scared, the only time we got out of the bunker was when we needed to use the toilet,\u201d says Paswan, who says she will never forget the time.\n\nFinding out that 10 Nepalis had been killed by Hamas did not help. \u201cThe news made us mentally weak,\u201d says Paswan. \u201cAll I was thinking was I would also die like my friends had.\u201d\n\nNitin Bhandari, another rescued student, vividly recalls the tragic loss of his two friends. \u201cThey were begging for their life. They told Hamas they were Nepali but they were shot dead.\u201d\n\nThe Hamas were not done as they threw two grenades into the bunker where some other Nepalis were hidden. One of the grenades was thrown back at the Hamas by Bipin Joshi. That Bhandari says, saved their lives. \u201cBipin saved us but then he was taken,\u201d says Bibhusa Adhikari.\n\nThe whereabouts of Joshi remains unknown. The Nepali Embassy in Israel says that he is missing but some who were with him say he was taken by the Hamas. Almost all the Nepalis who were repatriated to Nepal are worried about him and have been appealing to the government to help find their hero.\n\nThe dead have to wait\n\nThe government has not yet been able to bring back the bodies of the deceased, as they have not been released by the Israeli government. The remains will be repatriated soon. Despite successfully bringing back 254 Nepalis, there are still many more who need to be rescued from Israel.\n\nGiven reports of Nepalis being taken hostage by Hamas, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of these claims. Furthermore, due to Nepal\u2019s absence of diplomatic ties with Palestine, there is no established channel to communicate with Hamas for the safe return of these Nepali individuals.\n\nHuman rights activist Mohna Ansari says Nepal should seek help from countries that have diplomatic ties with Palestine. \u201cThe government needs to try to contact Palestine through whatever means possible,\u201d says Ansari.\n\nBut Hamas is not the Palestine government. With it being an extremist group, having dialogues with Hamas is highly unlikely.\n\nNo light at the end of the tunnel\n\nPhoto: XINHUA\n\nIsrael\u2019s assertiveness is escalating by the day. Ongoing attacks on Gaza, a region under Hamas control, are accompanied by heightened offensives in neighbouring countries such as Syria and Lebanon. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared a campaign aimed at the eradication of Hamas.\n\nMilitant groups from other countries that have besieged Israel are also intensifying their attacks.\n\nAccording to Sewa Lamsal, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the staff of the Nepali Embassy in Tel Aviv, are currently working from their bunker. They do not have permission to leave their bunkers. In such a situation, it is anticipated that the conflict in Israel will intensify.\n\nFurthermore, relocating Nepalis from both the southern and northern borders of Israel to safer cities like Tel Aviv might escalate potential harm if the conflict persists.\n\nBut the ones who are in Israel for employment are reluctant to return. According to Arjun Ghimire, first secretary at the Nepal Embassy in Israel, those who have registered their name to return to Nepal on the second day have withdrawn their name on the third day and most of them are workers.\n\nGiven the financial strain on families and the expenses incurred in travelling to Israel, many may find it difficult to decide to return to Nepal. Consequently, it appears imperative for the government to vigilantly monitor the situation in Israel and formulate contingency plans for their timely rescue in case of an emergency.","title":"Back home, Nepalis share the horrors of Hamas attack in Israel","url":"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepalis-still-unsafe-israel.html","video":[]}
