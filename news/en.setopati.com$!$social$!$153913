The government aims to tackle that by increasing quarantine of persons suspected of being infected. But it will be very difficult to check spread that way as many who needs to be quarantined after exposure to asymptomatic patients will not know they have been exposed to infected persons in lack of testing of asymptomatic persons.\n\nDr Adhikari added that the ministry will now stress on quarantine and isolation instead of just increasing testing through contact tracing. \"We should now quarantine people going to a district form another for 14 days,\" he stated.\n\nNepal is currently doing around 10,000 PCR tests a day and over 850,000 PCR tests have been done across the country until now.\n\nThe government recently has halved the fee for PCR test to Rs 2,000 from Rs 4,400.\n\nThe ministry is also discussing about providing free treatment only to the impoverished people and asking others to get treated on their own expenses. \"We have just initiated discussion along that line. It is up to the government to take the decision,\" Dr Adhikari said.","title":"Government mulling about not testing asymptomatic persons","url":"http://en.setopati.com/social/153913","video":[]}
