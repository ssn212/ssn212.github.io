I welcome this decision,\" said Guterres. \"The continuation is good news for the world.\"\n\nOutstanding issues remain, but representatives of Russia, Ukraine, T\u00fcrkiye and the United Nations will keep discussing them, he told reporters at the UN headquarters in New York. \"I hope we will reach a comprehensive agreement to improve, expand and extend the initiative, as I proposed in a recent letter to the presidents of the three countries.\"\n\nThe importance of the Black Sea Grain Initiative -- and the parallel memorandum of understanding between the United Nations and Russia on the facilitation of exports of Russian food and fertilizer -- is clear. These agreements matter for global food security. Ukrainian and Russian products feed the world, said Guterres.\n\nUnder the Black Sea Grain Initiative, more than 30 million tons of food have been exported. Vital food supplies are reaching some of the world's most vulnerable people and places, including 30,000 tons of wheat that just left Ukraine to feed hungry people in Sudan, said the UN chief.\n\nThe agreements matter because the world is still in the throes of a record-breaking cost-of-living crisis. And they matter because they demonstrate that, even in the darkest hours, there is always a beacon of hope and an opportunity to find solutions that benefit everyone, he said.\n\nGuterres noted that over the last year, global food markets have stabilized, volatility has been reduced and global food prices fell by 20 percent.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we hope that exports of food and fertilizers, including ammonia, from the Russian Federation and Ukraine will be able to reach global supply chains safely and predictably -- as foreseen in both the Black Sea Initiative and the memorandum of understanding on Russian food and fertilizer exports, the implementation of which the United Nations is fully committed to supporting,\" he said.\n\nThe Black Sea Grain Initiative was signed separately by Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul with T\u00fcrkiye and the United Nations on July 22, 2022. The deal, initially in effect for 120 days, was extended in mid-November 2022 for another 120 days till March 18, 2023. At that point, Russia only agreed to extend the deal for a further 60 days, till May 18, 2023.\n\nAs a parallel agreement, Russia and the United Nations signed a memorandum of understanding on the facilitation of exports of Russian food and fertilizer. But the parallel agreement has not made much progress.","title":"UN chief welcomes Russian decision to extend Black Sea grain deal","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/27780/decision-to-extend-","video":[]}
