If we take in polluted air everyday, (it could lead to) respiratory and pulmonary diseases, even asthma. It can affect cognitive development of children or even mental health,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked about Jakarta\u2019s pollution problem on Tuesday, President Widodo told reporters the solution would be to move the country\u2019s capital city from Jakarta to Nusantara, which his government is currently building from the ground up on Borneo island.\n\nIndonesia is set to name Nusantara as the new capital next year and at least 16,000 civil servants, military and police are due to move there.\n\n(VOA/Reuters)","title":"Indonesia\u2019s capital Jakarta named world\u2019s most polluted city","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/10/313944/","video":[]}
