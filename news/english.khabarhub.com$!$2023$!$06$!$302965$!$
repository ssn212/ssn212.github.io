(Photo: AP)\n\nSAUDI ARABIA: The two warring factions in the Sudan conflict sent envoys to Saudi Arabia on Friday to negotiate a firm cease-fire agreement, according to officials.\n\nThe talks, to begin Saturday in the Saudi city of Jeddah, are the result of an international effort to bring the two sides to face to face, hoping to negotiate an end to the fighting.\n\nSudanese officials told The Associated Press the talks in Jeddah would be facilitated by Saudi Arabia and the United States.\n\nThe Sudanese officials also told AP that opening humanitarian corridors in Khartoum and Omdurman and providing protection to civilian infrastructure, including health facilities, will be among the topics discussed.\n\nSaturday will be the first time representatives from Sudan\u2019s military, led by General Abdel-Fattah Burhan, and the rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, led by General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, have met for talks since the fighting erupted on April 15.\n\nThe fighting has killed hundreds, forced hundreds of thousands to flee, and has brought Sudan to the brink of collapse.\n\nThe talks Saturday come after previous fragile cease-fire agreements failed to end the fighting.\n\nThe United Nations migration agency said this week that at least 334,000 people have been internally displaced by the fighting, in addition to the 100,000 who have fled the country. The U.N. refugee agency has warned the fighting could cause more than 800,000 people to flee Sudan.\n\nMany are going to the seven countries bordering Sudan, including Chad, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, Egypt and Ethiopia.\n\nMost aid operations have been suspended or severely scaled back due to the lack of security. Several aid workers have been killed in the fighting. The Norwegian Refugee Council said Wednesday that one of their Sudanese volunteers was killed Sunday in the volatile city of Geneina in West Darfur.\n\nLooting also has hampered aid operations.\n\nThe World Food Program said earlier this week that nearly 17,000 tons of food had been stolen from its warehouses across Sudan.\n\n\u201cThis would translate to about 13 or 14 million U.S. dollars,\u201d Eddie Row, the WFP country director, said in an interview Thursday with Reuters. \u201d Almost every day we are receiving reports of additional looting.\u201d\n\nWFP has said it is working to determine what supplies remain. Before the fighting, WFP had more than 80,000 tons of stock in the country. The agency still plans to provide food assistance for 384,000 people in the coming days.\n\nThe U.N. refugee agency\u2019s Darfur coordinator said looting has long been a problem in Darfur, and many of their facilities have been robbed since April 15.\n\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said Thursday it has launched an emergency appeal to support the Sudanese Red Crescent Society to deliver assistance to 200,000 people.\n\nVOA","title":"Sudan\u2019s warring factions sit for talks Saturday in Saudi Arabia","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/06/302965/","video":[]}
