The woman, who is now pursuing her master\u2019s level, is planning her pregnancy only after completing her studies. But she fears that using contraceptives may lead to \u201cinfertility\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am afraid that sometimes friends would say that using temporary means of family planning before a baby is born will make it difficult to conceive. I heard that contraceptives may lead to infertility,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, her spouse is not interested in using contractive himself adding to her problem. \u201cSometimes the issue has been so intense that I fear conceiving a baby while having sexual intercourse. I am always afraid that my studies will get affected if I have a baby,\u201d she shared.\n\nA 24-year-old woman, who worked for a private organization, had to quit her job after she has an unwanted pregnancy. \u201cIt has been one and a half years since I was married. Now, I am five months pregnant. We had planned of not to have a baby for some years. But I did not use contraceptives as I heard that they may lead to infertility. My spouse did not use them either,\u201d she said. They had thought of resorting to abortion. \u201cBut we abandoned the idea after we heard that I may not conceive another baby if I have a first abortion. I am now facing many problems since I conceived a baby,\u201d she said.\n\nA Buhari (daughter-in-law) group with 70,000 members has been formed. The group members every day openly shared their problems on social media. A group member writes, \u201cMy husband does not use contraceptives while having intercourse. We have a three-year-old baby girl. We are not planning to have another child until some years. But I had an abortion three times after having an unwanted pregnancy. I would gain weight and it will be difficult to conceive a baby if I use temporary means of family planning. I need appropriate suggestions.\u201d\n\nResponding to the post, many members suggested having a three-month contraceptive injection while some others proposed that husbands should use contraceptives.\n\nMany married women have misconceptions about contraceptives thus inviting many problems, said health workers.\n\nHowever, doctors have ruled out any such misconception that contraceptive devices lead to infertility. Women are forced to have unwanted pregnancies without consulting a doctor, said gynecologist and obstetrician Dr Madan Khadka.\n\n\u201cThere are misconceptions in society that using temporary means of family planning before having a first child leads to infertility. This is completely baseless. One should not use contraceptives without a doctor\u2019s consultation. All contraceptives are safe. There is no need to fear,\u201d he said. Temporary means of family planning prevents unwanted pregnancy, he said, adding, \u201cOne should not follow misconceptions as contraceptives are scientifically tested. Such misconceptions about contraceptives may lead to only mental and physical problems.\u201d He stressed the need for imparting education about reproductive health.\n\nThe issue of conceiving a child should take place in mutual understanding between both husband and wife. \u201cBut in our society, having a child is related only to a woman. Men should cooperate until their wives are ready mentally and physically to have children. They can use contraceptives,\u201d he said.\n\nThe effects of contraceptives remain only until using them. One can conceive a baby sometime after discontinuing them, he said. According to him, women of any age group should consult doctors before using contraceptive devices.\n\nDespite the campaign \u2018My Body My Rights\u2019 in place, women continue being forced to have unwanted pregnancies, said women rights activist Bina Silwal.\n\n\u201cIt requires the protection of the right of reproductive health. The mindset of treating women as a machine to give birth should be changed,\u201d she said. Women cannot openly speak about the right to reproductive health under pressure of families, she said. \u201cWomen worry about the issue of giving birth after marriage. There is a situation where only women are subject to using contraceptives or facing consequences. Only women are in tension when they are infertile. They themselves have to face the consequences of unwanted pregnancy.\u201d\n\nThe responsibility of family planning belongs to both women and men. But men seek only sexual pleasure by not using contraceptives while women have to face the risk of the consequences possibly caused by this, she said. For increasing equal participation of both men and women in family planning, there is a need for public education on reproductive health and understanding between the couple, she viewed.\n\nAccording to Article 38 (2) of the constitution of Nepal, every woman shall have the right to safe motherhood and reproductive health. But this has not been practically implemented, said advocate Bhagawati Pahari. \u201cA monitoring is required to ensure if women\u2019s right to reproductive health is being implemented.\u201d\n\nWomen give up their wishes when they put the happiness of the family at the center, and they should become part of the consequence, she viewed. Data showing only a few men using contraceptives has indicated that women are deprived of enjoying their right to reproductive health, she said.\n\nAccording to data from the Ministry of Health and Population for the fiscal year, 2021/22, three percent of women underwent sterilization and only one percent of men. Similarly, 14 percent of women have got birth control implants in place and two percent copper IUDs, 38 percent use Depo Provera and 19 percent pills. But only 23 percent of men use contraceptive devices.","title":"Misconceptions about contraceptives affecting mental and physical well-being of women","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/19/315136/","video":[]}
