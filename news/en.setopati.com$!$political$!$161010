There were 83 Maoist lawmakers in the reinstated Parliament.\n\nThe 2006 Jana Andolan had revived the dissolved House of Representatives. On November 7, 2006, the then seven parties and CPN (Maoist) reached an agreement. The Maoists became part of the interim legislature as per the agreement.\n\nFudung was elected lawmaker during that time, while there were talks that Rai would also be made lawmaker.\n\n\u201cThe question of army integration was important after joining the peace process. We also had to make the party the best in state operation and policy-making,\u201d a Maoist Center leader says. \u201cNot only Kumar Fudung and Indrajit Rai, Surya Bahadur Sen Oli and Rabindra Pratap Shah also became associated during the process of establishing the party in all areas.\u201d\n\nIndrajit, whose ancestral home is in Aamchowk Rural Municipality of Bhojpur, was in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh of India. He claims to have done his PhD from there.\n\nAccording to a Maoist leader, Indrajit had come to Nepal from Bhopal as per the wish of the then royal family in the 1990s and started providing training at the Army Staff College. It shows that he had close relations with the then royal family.\n\nHowever, when the Maoists joined mainstream politics after the 2006 Jana Andolan, Rai broke off his close ties with the royals and became associated with the Maoists through Ram Bahadur Thapa.\n\nThe Maoists had formed three commands \u2013 western, central and eastern \u2013 during the armed conflict. Thapa was in-charge of the eastern command.\n\nThapa was also known as the military strategist of CPN (Maoist) during that period.\n\nRai came in contact with Thapa as he was also a high-level Maoist leader of the eastern region, with Gopal Kirati and other leaders from the east acting as facilitators. Maoist leaders opine that he grew close to Thapa also because he was a military expert.\n\n\u201cMaoists had military knowledge; he came in contact with Thapa thinking he could have an influence on issues such as international practice, peace process and army integration. He took advantage of that,\u201d a Maoist leader says.\n\nRai became a lawmaker through the proportional representation (PR) system in the first Constituent Assembly.\n\nThe then government had formed a special committee for army integration under the leadership of former lieutenant general Balananda Sharma. Rai played a managerial role on behalf of the party in the committee.\n\nUnified CPN (Maoist) split in June 2012, with leaders including Mohan Baidya and Ram Bahadur Thapa forming CPN (Maoist).\n\nRai, who was advisor in UCPN (Maoist), sided with Thapa after the split. He was given the role of advisor in the new party too and continued to remain close to Thapa.\n\nAccording to a leader who was in Thapa\u2019s secretariat then, Rai was not really active in party activities and had a tendency to be close to the leadership. The leadership trusted him easily as Rai had given advice and suggestions on army integration, the leader says.\n\nThapa was appointed home minister on February 26, 2018, while Rai was appointed as the home minister\u2019s security advisor only on June 29. The Home Ministry cannot appoint security advisor on its own; the Cabinet has to take the decision. According to leaders who were then in Thapa\u2019s secretariat, Rai was appointed as per the wish of the then prime minister KP Sharma Oli.\n\nThere was a \u2018cold war\u2019 between Rai and other members of Thapa\u2019s secretariat during that period. There was no coordination as Rai\u2019s focus was more on meetings with intermediaries than on the ministry\u2019s works, according to the then secretariat members.\n\n\u201cThere was talks that he had bee appointed as per the prime minister\u2019s wish. The present case was not discussed in the ministry. It must have been fixed outside,\u201d an officer who was in the Home Ministry during that period says.\n\nLess than a decade after joining the peace process, the Maoist party suffered splits. The Netra Bikram Chand-led group broke away from the Mohan Baidya group in 2014. Thapa\u2019s group returned to UCPN (Maoist) in 2016.\n\nWhen CPN was formed on May 17, 2018, Rai, who had remained with Thapa all along, was not in the party\u2019s executive committee and was given the role of advisor.\n\nCPN split after the then prime minister Oli dissolved the House of Representatives on December 20, 2020.\n\nStanding committee members Dev Gurung, Pampha Bhusal and other leaders considered close to Thapa joined the faction led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal.\n\nHowever, Thapa was still undecided.\n\nDuring a central committee meeting called by the Dahal-Nepal faction, Pampha Bhusal had said that Thapa would also not remain with Oli.\n\nThere were 27 central members from Thapa\u2019s group then.\n\n\u201cAll of us were in favor of not supporting the Parliament dissolution,\u201d a central member who supported Thapa then says. \u201cApart from Dawa Thapa who represented Sindhupalchowk, others were not in favor of remaining with Oli.\u201d\n\nThapa was home minister then, and Rai used to be part of nearly every meeting as his advisor.\n\n\u201cWe used to hold meeting at the minister\u2019s quarters in Pulchowk every day. Rai was the only one in the meetings who said that we should remain with Oli,\u201d another leader from the Thapa group says, adding that Thapa remained in UML on Rai\u2019s insistence.\n\nThapa managed to keep only Dawa and Manoj Thapa among the 27 central members in UML, according to the leader.\n\nRai is currently in police custody on the charge of swindling millions of rupees from Nepalis with the promise of sending them to America as Bhutanese refugees. Victims have said that Rai and his son Niraj took Rs 55 million between June 2019 and March 2020. Others arrested in the case have corroborated it in their statements. Rai\u2019s son Niraj is absconding.\n\nRai is a member of the UML advisors\u2019 committee. However, the party has not suspended him.\n\nThe UML secretariat meeting is taking place on Tuesday while the central committee\u2019s fifth meeting is also set to take place in Kathmandu from May 11 to May 13. Deputy chief of UML\u2019s publicity department said that the case will be discussed in the meetings.\n\n\u201cPolice investigation in the case is underway. There is no conclusion yet. Our secretariat and central committee meetings are also taking place. We will discuss there and take a decision,\u201d Rijal said.","title":"Indrajit Rai's connection with Ram Bahadur Thapa","url":"http://en.setopati.com/political/161010","video":[]}
