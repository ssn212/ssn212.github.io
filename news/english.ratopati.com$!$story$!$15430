At a virtual programme organised on the occasion of the 41st Social Service Day today, the PM said that the social organisations are expected to work on humanitarian ground. \"True philanthropists do not take anything.\n\nThey serve others. What such persons have sacrificed in the name of social service is important. Not only the non-governmental and governmental organisations even an individual should assist the best with a completely humanitarian aspiration,\" the PM added. The PM observed that the activities of the social organisations are vital in the places where government's interventions and capacities were not sufficient, adding that the government's job was to work for poverty alleviation and management of fundamental rights.\n\nPM Oli said that the Social Welfare Council (SWC) should coordinate and mobilize the philanthropic and cooperative organizations that are willing to support something.\n\nOn the occasion, Minister for Women, Children and Senior Citizens Parbat Gurung said that preparations were ongoing to unveil Integrated Act by replacing the Panchayat-era Act after receiving the comments on flawed activities of the organisations.
