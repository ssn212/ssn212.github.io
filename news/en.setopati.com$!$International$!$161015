A statement issued by the Saudi foreign ministry on Monday said the negotiations between delegations from the country\u2019s military, on one side, and on the other the powerful paramilitary, the Rapid Support Forces, are expected to go on for a few more days.\n\nThe talks, which are focused on creating humanitarian corridors to allow aid and civilians to move, are part of a broader diplomatic initiative proposed by Saudi Arabia and the U.S. to stop the fighting.\n\nThe doctors\u2019 union did not specify the two parties to the clashes in Genena, a city of around half a million people located near the border with Chad that has been a flashpoint since the early days of the fighting.\n\nLate last month, residents described how armed fighters, many wearing the uniform of the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary, rampaged through the city, looting shops and homes and battling with rival forces. They said the fighting was dragging in tribal militias, tapping into longtime hatreds between the region\u2019s two main communities \u2014 one that identifies as Arab, the other as East or Central African.\n\nIn the early 2000s, African tribes in Darfur that had long complained of discrimination rebelled against the Khartoum government, which responded with a military campaign that the International Criminal Court later said amounted to genocide. State-backed Arab militias known as the Janjaweed were accused of widespread killings, rapes and other atrocities. The Janjaweed later evolved into the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group, known as the RSF.\n\nAt least 481 civilians were killed in Khartoum clashes that erupted in mid-April between the military, led by Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the RSF, led by Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, according to the same doctors\u2019 statement. The number of the wounded among civilians has jumped to more than 2,560.\n\nOn Friday, the governor of West Darfur, where Genena is located, accused the RSF of damaging government offices, setting fire to more than 10 shelters housing displaced communities, and looting homes and stores.\n\n\u201cToday, West Darfur is a doomed province. What is left of the Darfur population lives under very harsh conditions,\u201d Gen. Khamis Abdullah Abkar said in a video posted on a local news site Friday.\n\n\u201cThe international community should not remain silent about the challenge in this province. It should act immediately; people need shelter, food and medicine,\u201d he said.\n\nThe paramilitary has repeatedly denied claims that its forces have terrorized civilians or used brutal tactics.\n\nOn Monday, Sudan\u2019s leading pro-democracy alliance, which has spearheaded protests against the country\u2019s military leaders since 2019, expressed its support for the Jeddah talks and called for an immediate cessation of fighting.\n\nIn a statement released Monday, the Forces for the Declaration of Freedom and Change stressed the need for a \u201ccomprehensive political solution that would achieve peace, justice, a transition to civilian democratic rule and a military and security reform.\u201d","title":"Sudan doctors: At least 100 killed in Darfur clashes","url":"http://en.setopati.com/International/161015","video":[]}
