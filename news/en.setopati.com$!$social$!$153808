It is higher than the two-way fare of normal times. And the government is stopping those who will be brought free of cost. The Nepalis whose visa has expired have to pay fine from September 11 on top of that,\" an entrepreneur told Setopati.\n\nSecretary at the ministry Kedar Bahadur Adhikari pointed that the government cannot provide quarantine and isolation facilities for more than 800 persons a day.\n\nThat is in stark contrast to Minister for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Yogesh Bhattarai's assertions that those testing negative can be sent to home quarantine after signing conditions. \"I don't know about this. I will comment when I know about it,\" Minister Bhattarai told Setopati when asked why the UAE's proposal has been turned down citing lack of quarantine facilities.\n\nThe government officials may point that the UAE can send the Nepalis through Nepali airlines if they want to send them free, and it is trying to give business to Etihad. But the UAE is well within its right to give business to its national flag carrier with the money it spends to send Nepalis for free.\n\nSome say that the government's refusal is not due to its policy of protecting Nepali airlines companies but because Nepali travel agents will not get any business if the Nepalis are sent in Etihad.\n\nThey say that a handful of entrepreneurs have been making hay throughout the pandemic by getting commission even in the chartered flights agreed directly with other governments, and the same entrepreneurs may have influenced the government to refuse the UAE proposal.\n\nThe Nepalis stranded abroad had to wait for almost three months after the government stopped international flights from March 24. Many countries operated chartered flights to rescue their nationals stranded here in Nepal. Their planes arrived here empty or Nepali planes that took them returned empty due to the government policy.\n\nThe government allowed chartered flights to Nepal only from June 14 and the Nepalis had to pay a very high fare, part of which went to the ticketing agents, for chartered flights. Nepali workers, who could have arrived at a significantly lower fare if they were allowed in the empty planes that arrived for or returned after chartered flights to rescue foreign nationals, had to pay a very high fare.\n\nThe government is now compounding matters refusing to even allow the UAE to bring Nepali workers home free of cost.","title":"Government refuses UAE proposal to bring 1,120 stranded Nepalis for free","url":"http://en.setopati.com/social/153808","video":[]}
