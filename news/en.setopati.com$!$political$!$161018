Police get 60 days for investigation of cases of organized crime while the quantum of punishment is also higher in cases of organized crime than that of fraud.\n\nKeshav Dulal, Sanu Bhandari, Tanka Kumara Gurung have been in police custody for the past 45 days as they were arrested on March 26. Police have been extending custody of people arrested on different dates after that.\n\nBased on the stay in custody of those who were arrested first, the District Police Range, Kathmandu, now has 15 days to investigate the case and hand it to the District Government Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nAfter the police submit the case, the District Government Attorney\u2019s Office will study the report and take it to the Kathmandu District Court to register the case, according to Kathmandu\u2019s district attorney Laxman Upadhyaya Ghimire.\n\n\u201cPolice will submit the report to us. We will have to study it and register the case by the 61st day,\u201d Ghimire said.\n\nPolice will also produce the arrested people in the court during the process.\n\nGhimire said that the investigation report will also include the names of those who need to be arrested for investigation and those against whom arrest warrants have been issued by the Kathmandu District Court.\n\nIf the police fail to arrest them during this period, they need to declare them fugitives and submit the report.\n\nThere is also a legal provision that allows fugitives to surrender directly in court even after a case has already been filed.\n\nIf other people are dragged into the case or need to be arrested, then police can move ahead with the investigation by keeping them in custody.\n\nSection 35 of the National Criminal Procedure (Code) Act, 2017 allows additional claims to be made against the accused.\n\n\u201cIf, based on the other relevant additional evidence found after a case has already been filed in the court, it appears necessary to make a charge also against other accused in that case, in addition to the accused against whom the case has already been filed, or to make additional charge against the person who has already been made accused upon the filing of the case, the government attorney may, setting out the reasons therefor, cause further investigation to be conducted, and file a case, making additional claim against the other additional accused also,\u201d it states.\n\nIf additional evidence is found after a case has already been filed in court, changes can be made in the charge sheet as per Section 36 of the Act.\n\nGhimire said that the District Police Range, Kathmandu, and the District Government Attorney\u2019s Office have both been working to submit the case on time.\n\nThe District Government Attorney\u2019s Office is currently taking statements of the arrested and others connected with the case.\n\nPolice have also been searching for fugitives including UML Secretary Rayamajhi. A Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) team has been deployed to search for Rayamajhi as he is suspected to have fled to India.\n\nThe District Police Range, Kathmandu, has also issued a circular to all 77 districts to arrest him.\n\nA number of people including political leaders and their sons have been accused of involvement in the scam that swindled tens of millions of rupees from Nepalis with the promise of sending them to America as Bhutanese refugees. Investigations show that the group had received money from people from Jhapa, Morang, Dang and other districts.\n\nThe Home Ministry had formed a task force under the then Joint Secretary Bal Krishna Panthi through a minister-level decision on June 13, 2019, to study the state of Bhutanese refugees in Nepal and provide recommendation/consultation for third-country resettlement. Current CPN-UML Vice-chairman Ram Bahadur Thapa was the home minister while current chief of the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) Prem Bahadur Rai was the home secretary.\n\nThe report prepared by the Panthi-led task force identified 429 people authenticated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as Bhutanese refugees. Police are now preparing to question Panthi after questions were raised that a few fake refugees may have been included even in that list.\n\nVictims of the scam had filed complaints at the Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office on June 1, 2022. But police started investigating the case by arresting Keshav Dulal, Sanu Bhandari and Tanka Kumara Gurung only on March 26 this year.","title":"Police have 15 days to submit file on fake Bhutanese refugees scam","url":"http://en.setopati.com/political/161018","video":[]}
