Similarly, the road linking Melamchi is in a sorry state, leading to difficulty for vehicles to pass.\n\nHowever, local level is unconcerned about the matter. Mayor of Shankharapur municipality has recently inspected the road and the settlement at risk.\n\nHe suggested that a study of the settlement and road at risk should be carried out. Initiatives would be taken to control the landslide, he said.
