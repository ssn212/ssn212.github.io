The phenomenon happens within the polar circles only.\n\nLikewise, the opposite of polar night is the midnight sun or also called a polar day.\n\nPolar nights particularly occur in the polar region during winter, for instance during September to March in the Northern Hemisphere, and March to September in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nAs polar region gradually tilts away from the Sun during winter, areas that are on the Earth\u2019s day side do not receive sunlight as the Sun remains below the horizon.\n\nWhere are Polar Nights seen?\n\nPolar nights are especially seen in several populated areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Even though Norway boasts itself as the Land of the Midnight Sun, Polar Nights can also be seen in parts of Canada, Alaska, Greenland, Russia, Finland and Sweden.\n\nLikewise, Antarctica is the only landmass in the Southern Hemisphere to have polar nights.\n\nPolar Nigh begins around the Equinox\n\nAt the North Pole, the polar night usually begins as the Sun sets around the Autumnal Equinox in September. This lasts for around 6 months until the Sun rises around the Spring Equinox in March when six months of Polar Day begin.\n\nAs the Sun dips below the horizon at the North Pole after September Equinox, the region experiencing Polar Night grows southwards until it encompasses almost all of the Arctic Circle around December Solstice.","title":"Polar Night Explained - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/08/125905/","video":[]}
