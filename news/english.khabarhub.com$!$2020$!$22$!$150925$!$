Oli is preparing to call an emergency meeting to this effect today itself.\n\nAccording to a highly-placed source, he is preparing to bring the ordinance on the party split by tweaking the previous one introduced in the Nepali month Baisakh.\n\nAccording to the existing provision, 40 percent of members are required to split the party in the central committee and the parliamentary party.\n\nOli has a plan to notch up 40 percent by appointing new central committee members after his faction lacks the required number.\n\nHe is preparing to add 300 new CC members through the CC meeting underway at Baluwatar. He is also preparing to administer them an oath of office and secrecy today itself.\n\nThe NCP has a total of 441 CC members including 241 from the then CPN-UML and 200 from CPN (Maoist Center). In the former CPN-UML, Oli has 131 and Madhav Nepal has 110 CC members. Similarly, in the former CPN (Maoist Center), Prachanda has 178 and Ram Bahadur Thapa has 22 CC members.\n\nLatest political developments have shown Thapa group is in support of Prachanda. Given this number, Dahal-Nepal faction will have a total of 306 central CC members while Oli will have only 135 members. Oli has claimed that seven CC members have recently joined his faction from Dahal-Nepal group.\n\nThe party\u2019s post of the chairman will remain vacant after the Dahal-Nepal faction will take a disciplinary action against Oli. The majority of CC member are preparing to appoint Nepal to the post of the chairman.\n\nBoth the factions are currently fighting for the legitimacy after the NCP headed towards the verge of split 32 months after the unification. Oli faction has been claiming the party\u2019s name, flag and party office arguing that Oli is the first chairman of the party.\n\nOn the other hand, Dahal-Nepal group has been stating that Oli as the chairman will lose his legitimacy once he is penalized by the majority of the party\u2019s CC members.\n\nThe NPC is on the verge of split after the intra-party dispute reached a new height especially after Prime Minister Oli, who is also the chairman of the parry, challenged the party\u2019s decision to nominate Vice Chairman Bam Dev Gautam as a lawmaker to the National Assembly 10 months ago in the Nepali month Falgun.","title":"PM Oli preparing to bring ordinance on party split, adding new CC members - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/22/150925/","video":[]}
