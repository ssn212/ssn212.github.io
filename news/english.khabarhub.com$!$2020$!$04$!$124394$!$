Being one of the largest oil producers Iran has much to offer China by way of energy, the latter being the largest importer importing ten million barrels a day last year. It gets 75 percent of its oil from abroad.\n\nThe partnership was first proposed by President Xi Jinping during a visit to Iran in 2016. According to Iran\u2019s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif the deal was approved by President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s cabinet in June.\n\nThe document is said to be labelled \u2018final version\u2019 dated June 2020. It has not yet been submitted to Iran\u2019s parliament for approval. It has not been made public, leading to suspicions about how much the government could be giving away to China.\n\nNor have the terms of the deal been made clear by officials in Beijing. The caution could be on account of the fact that the partnership could create potentially dangerous flashpoints in a new sector in the face of deteriorating relations between the US and China.\n\nThe Overwhelming Benefits to China from the Deal\n\nThe Chinese investments in Iran, which would total up to 400 billion dollars over 25 years, could trigger punitive actions against Chinese firms.\n\nThe draft deal with Iran shows that China feels it is powerful enough to withstand US penalty, the advantages accruing to it from the deal far outweigh the effect of any penalties.\n\nFor example, India was the third largest crude oil importer in the world in 2018. The country spent an estimated \u20b98.81 lakh crore (US$120 billion) to import 228.6 million tonnes of crude oil in 2018\u201319; China\u2019s annual crude oil imports in 2019 increased to an average of 10.1 million barrels per day (b/d), an increase of 0.9 million b/d from the 2018 average.\n\nChina remains the world\u2019s top crude oil importer, surpassing the United States in 2017; In 2012, Iran, which exported around 1.5 million barrels of crude oil a day, was the second-largest exporter among the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n\nIn the same year, officials in Iran estimated that Iran\u2019s annual oil and gas revenues could reach $250 billion by 2015.In 2018, Iran exported around 650,000 b/d of oil to China, according to S&P Global Platts cFlow data and shipping sources.\n\nIran must take into account its relations with India, the most important country in the region with close relations and civilizational ties that have linked the two countries through the millennia.\n\nExtrapolating from the above figures and taking for granted that Iran could produce several million barrels per day at the very least, China could potentially save well over 10 to 15 billion dollars a year from substantially discounted oil prices from Iran if not more, especially were the price of oil to rise.\n\nIt would give it a huge advantage over other oil importing countries till 2045. (These are back of envelope calculations requiring expert review).\n\nTo save repetition the other substantial advantages that China gains from the deal will emerge from consideration under the next heading below.\n\nMost importantly, geo strategically China gains a foothold in Iran with ports on the Arabian Sea and control of the oil flow choke points from the Gulf. The aspect requires a separate paper to study the full ramifications.\n\nWhat does Iran get from the Deal?\n\nThe Iranians are shrewd negotiators. On the face of it since China was willing to break the US embargo and face the consequences the Mullahs should have gone in for straightforward oil for cash deal, depending on the price of oil anything up to 25 billion dollars or more at the prevailing prices.\n\nThere would have been reasons for making a more complex deal many of whose trade-offs might never see the light of day.\n\nChina\u2019s benefits will further increase because the roughly 15 billion dollars per year pledged to Iran will comprise over 10 billion dollars of infrastructure material, steel, cement and allied materials supplied directly from China\u2019s mills for Iranian infrastructure, benefiting Chinese industry handsomely.\n\nThe remainder 5 billion dollars or so could be services, salaries and other disbursals, i.e., not much cash changing hands.\n\nInstead China is likely to have offered weapons technology transfers possibly including nuclear materials as it did in the case of Pakistan. Failing which the deal does not make much sense for Iran.\n\nWere India to get a waiver from the Americans its oil imports from Iran would be substantial. A deal with China automatically puts paid to good relations with India.\n\nSeeing how China has treated its closest and only ally Pakistan in implementing the CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) deal as well as the Hambantota deal with Sri Lanka, Iran is unlikely to allow itself to fall into a debt trap.\n\nIt will ensure that its relations with China remain one of equals. The reason is that Iran has much more to lose than China.\n\nWhen President Trump walked out of the nuclear deal without consulting any of the other signatories, the latter continued to back Iran.\n\nThey have been doing so till this day. Once the deal with China is ratified France, Germany, Japan and all US allies will cut off with Iran; a very major geopolitical price to pay.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the Arab countries will go in for additional armaments to match anything the Chinese give Iran.\n\nAn arms race in the region would be disastrous for all the countries in the region with China watching from the side lines.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nIran must take into account its relations with India, the most important country in the region with close relations and civilizational ties that have linked the two countries through the millennia.\n\nAs late as the nineteenth century the language of Maharaja Ranjit Singh\u2019s court was Persian. When this writer was in Iran* he was told that Farsi-e- qadimi (old pre-Arabised Persian) is preserved more in certain cities in India (Aligarh and Lucknow) than in Iran.\n\nWere India to get a waiver from the Americans its oil imports from Iran would be substantial. A deal with China automatically puts paid to good relations with India.\n\nThe consequences of that break will not stop at the Indian border. The Majority of the countries to the East of India \u2013 ASEAN, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea would prefer to see Iran through India\u2019s lens. The picture is unlikely to appear rosy.\n\nAnd last but not the least it is well on the cards that Mr. Joe Biden wins the elections in November. On becoming President suppose he were to lift the sanctions on Iran along with many other global changes that President Trump has brought about. Where will that leave Iran?\n\n(Synopsis of the reported deal as gleaned from the NY Times report)\n\n*Attending the Imperial Iranian War College in Tehran 1973-74\n\n(Major General Vinod Saighal is a retired Indian Army Officer, and Executive Director of Eco Monitors Society)","title":"Has Iran Put Its Foot Into It By Going Ahead With China Deal? - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/04/124394/","video":[]}
