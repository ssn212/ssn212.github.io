We don\u2019t respond to coercion or heavy handed threats wherever they come from,\u201d Frydenberg said in a statement, referring to the Facebook threat.\n\nThe draft legislation that aims to make Australia succeed where other countries have failed in forcing the companies to compensate media businesses for news content was made public in July.\n\nA public consultation period ended last week.\n\nFrydenberg has said he hopes Parliament will pass the legislation this year.","title":"Facebook threatens to block posting of news stories in Australia","url":"http://en.setopati.com/social/153800","video":[]}
