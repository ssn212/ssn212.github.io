It has faced destabilizing attacks by armed extremist groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group since 2013.\n\nIn 2021, France and its European partners who were engaged in the fight against extremists in Mali\u2019s north withdrew from the country after the junta brought in mercenaries from Russia\u2019s Wagner Group.\n\nThe United States warned Mali\u2019s military government in April that it would be \u201cirresponsible\u201d for the United Nations to continue deploying its more than 15,000 peacekeepers unless the western African nation ended restrictions, including on operating reconnaissance drones, and carried out political commitments toward peace and elections in March 2024.\n\nThe warning came as the U.N. Security Council considers three options proposed by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for the peacekeeping mission\u2019s future: increase its size, reduce its footprint, or withdraw troops and police and turn it into a political mission. Its current mandate expires on June 30.\n\nDujarric said the peacekeeper killed on Friday was the ninth to die in Mali this year.\n\n\u201cThis tragic loss is a stark reminder of the risks that peacekeepers in Mali and other places around the world face while tirelessly working to bring stability and peace to the people of Mali,\u201d he said.\n\n(VOA)","title":"UN Peacekeeper killed, 8 seriously injured in Northern Mali attack","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/10/306846/","video":[]}
