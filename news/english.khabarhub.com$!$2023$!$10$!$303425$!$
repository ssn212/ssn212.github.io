(File photo)\n\nKATHMANDU: CPN-UML deputy general-secretary Prithivi Subba Gurung asserted that his party was committed to cooperating with the government in the investigation of the fake Bhutanese refugee scam.\n\nParticipating in the discussions over the principles and priorities of the Appropriation Bill-2023/24 in today\u2019s meeting of the House of Representatives, leader Gurung reiterated the party\u2019s support for the government\u2019s initiatives in the case.\n\n\u201cThe way the government has initiated an investigation into the scam, I, as a member of the parliament representing the party that upholds the value of the rule of the law and corruption-free Nepal, believe that the government should launch an impartial investigation and make sure that the culprits are not spared while the innocent ones are not prosecuted,\u201d asserted Gurung.\n\nHe informed that his party had issued an instruction to cooperate in the investigation against the party\u2019s parliamentarian Top Bahadur Rayamajhi who is also alleged into the scam.\n\nEmphasizing the principles and priorities that should salvage the national economy stuck in recession, he commented that the priorities were not clear in terms of policy, structure, and principles.\n\n\u201cThe budget should instill confidence. The priorities fail to reflect the efforts to instill confidence,\u201d he commented, suggesting the government resort to austerity measures, cutting down the number of ministries and departments in the both federal and provincial governments.\n\nMeanwhile, Nepali Congress parliamentarian Gagan Kumar Thapa demanded stern action against anyone involved in the fake Bhutanese refugee scam irrespective of his/her designation and party affiliation.\n\nAlso taking part in the same discussion in the HoR meeting, Thapa cautioned that the investigation into the scam could be negatively influenced by the \u201drumors\u2019 of the market and the \u201cpolitical meetings.\u201d\n\nDemanding a fair and impartial investigation, he urged the government not to spare the guilty ones whether it involved political leader and their families or kin.\n\nOn a different note, he viewed that the economy was flagging due to some structural problems of the national economy, and the economic situation reaching today\u2019s condition was due to weakness on the part of the political parties.\n\nHe advised the government to set a budget schedule to discuss principles and priorities months before presenting it before the parliament.\n\nRSS","title":"UML to cooperate govt in investigation into fake Bhutanese refugee scam: Deputy general-secretary Gurung","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/10/303425/","video":[]}
