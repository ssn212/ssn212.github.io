The locals, some of whom are without face masks, are still pulling the chariot.\n\n\"The chariot has to be taken to Bungmati before the Malamas starts. The people have come and started to pull the chariot as the Guthi Sansthan did not make arrangements for pulling the chariot and the deadline is approaching,\" leader in building the chariot Dil Kumar Bahari told Setopati.\n\nBuilding of the chariot should have started on April 9 but did not due to the lockdown. It started only on June 24. Pulling of the chariot, as per the delayed schedule, should have started on August 17 but it was stopped on instruction of the Guthi Sansthan.\n\nBahari said the locals have started to pull the chariot now as it should reach Bungmati before the Dashain, which starts immediately after end of the Malamas this year, and it cannot be pulled during the extra lunar month.","title":"Locals start pulling Rato Machchhindranath chariot defying prohibitory orders","url":"http://en.setopati.com/social/153822","video":[]}
