In view of rapid transmission of the virus of late, the hospital has come up with the decision to make the coronavirus test mandatory for all cancer survivor patients prior to the treatment. Hospital\u2019s executive director Dr Dej Kumar Gautam said providing treatment to coronavirus-infected patients with other patients would accelerate chances for virus transmission to the hospital staff and patients.\n\nDr Gautam further said it would not be otherwise to initiate cancer treatment only following liberation from coronavirus which normally takes two-week-long medical interventions. \u201cSince mortality rate would likely go up by 25 to 35 percent while treating cancer survivors with corona patients, PCR test of the people coming for cancer treatment is a must\u201d, he added. Those diagnosed with corona infection would only be treated after they test negative for the virus, Dr Gautam noted.\n\nIn addition, the hospital has enforced a rule of \u2018one patient, one caregiver\u2019 to avoid the transmission of virus infection. The emergency and OPD services are smoothly running in the hospital as earlier, he shared, adding preparation is underway to operate PCR test lab soon. As many as 42 health workers and staff of the hospital have been so far diagnosed with coronavirus infection.\n\nSeven among them have recovered. Normally the hospital has been providing cancer treatment service to 700-800 patients daily but now only one-fourth of the number are visiting the hospital for treatment, the hospital administration said.","title":"BP Koirala Cancer Hospital makes corona test mandatory before cancer treatment","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/15038","video":[]}
