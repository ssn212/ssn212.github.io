Earlier this year it unveiled an $8-a-month plan to get a \u201cverified\u201d account.\n\nA recent study by the disinformation monitoring group NewsGuard found that verified, paying subscribers were the big spreaders of misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\u201cNearly three-fourths of the most viral posts on X advancing misinformation about the Israel-Hamas War are being pushed by \u2018verified\u2019 X accounts,\u201d the group said.\n\nIt said the 250 most-engaged posts that promoted one of 10 prominent false or unsubstantiated narratives related to the war were viewed more than 100 million times globally in just one week.\n\nNewsGuard said 186 of those posts were made from verified accounts and only 79 had been fact-checked by Community Notes.\n\nVerified accounts \u201cturned out to be a boon for bad actors sharing misinformation,\u201d said NewsGuard.\n\n\u201cFor less than the cost of a movie ticket, they have gained the added credibility associated with the once-prestigious blue checkmark and enabling them to reach a larger audience on the platform,\u201d it said.\n\nWhile the organization said it found misinformation spreading widely on other social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Telegram, it added that it found false narratives about the Israel-Hamas war tend to go viral on X before spreading elsewhere.\n\n(AFP/VOA)","title":"Musk pulls plug on paying for X fact checks","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/31/324195/","video":[]}
