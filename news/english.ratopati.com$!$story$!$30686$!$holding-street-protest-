For that, teachers from all the 77 districts have gathered in Kathmandu.\n\nThey are holding a protest in Maitighar Mandala from 11 am today on the call of the Confederation of Nepalese Teachers (CNT).\n\nThe confederation has put forward an 18-point demand for amendment in the current bill, in which there are demands such as transfer, promotion, post requirement, not staying under the local municipal level, and others.\n\nThe confederation has promised to complete the courses in extra time which has been affected due to the protest. It has asked the parents and students to understand their difficulties saying that closing the schools is not their desire but a compulsion.\n\nVarious concerned bodies have asked not to protest, such as the Nepal Municipality Association, and National Rural Municipality Federation, and have asked to find an alternative to the movement saying that the issue of disagreement can be resolved through negotiations and talks. The government has also called for negotiations. However, the teachers have said there is no point in the negotiations now.","title":"Teachers from all over the country holding street protest in Kathmandu starting today","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/30686/holding-street-protest-","video":[]}
