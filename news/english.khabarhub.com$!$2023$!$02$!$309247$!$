Any healthy person can donate organs and the law now provides that transplants can be done through 52 kinds of relatives.\n\nSimilarly, Dr Kalpana Shrestha said there is a possibility that even the brain can be preserved and transplanted within 24 hours after death.\n\nShe also pointed out gender-based discrimination in kidney transplantation in Nepal.\n\n\u201cThe number of female kidney transplant patients receiving organs from men is very low\u201d, she said, \u201cCompared to this, the number of male patients receiving kidneys from women is very high.\u201d\n\nTransplant specialist Dr Dipesh Shrestha and nephrologist Dr Shakti Basnet said that it is necessary to raise awareness about transplants in society.","title":"Number of chronic diseases increasing lately","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/02/309247/","video":[]}
