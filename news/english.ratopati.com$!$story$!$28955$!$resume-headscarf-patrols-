At the time, there were reports that officers beat Amini's head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles.\n\nIt enraged millions of Iranians - leading to months of violent anti-government protests across the country, that saw nearly 600 protesters killed, including several state executions.\n\nIn the months following the protests, many women stopped wearing hijabs altogether. It was the biggest outright challenge to the rule of the clerics in Iran since the 1979 revolution.\n\nVideos posted on social media suggest that, until recently, the sight of women not wearing hijabs was becoming more commonplace.\n\nBut in turn, the Iranian authorities brought in stiffer punishments, including forcing businesses to close if they did not comply with the hijab laws.\n\nAlthough the protests drew out huge numbers of Iranians, some people still staunchly support the strict dress code.\n\nEarlier this year, a video emerged showing a man throwing a tub of yoghurt in the face of two unveiled women. His action was met with outrage by male and female bystanders, and he was later arrested - but so were the women.\n\nSpeaking to the Reuters news agency, university student Ismail said she did not think the authorities would be able to reimpose the dress codes.\n\n\"They cannot impose it like before - the number of people who do not obey is too high now,\" she said. \"They cannot handle all of us, the last thing they can do is use violence and force against us. They cannot do it.\"\n\nIran has had various forms of \"morality police\" since the revolution. This latest version, known formally as the Guidance Patrol (Gasht-e Ershad), began its patrols in 2006.\n\nIt is unclear how many men and women work for the force, but they have access to weapons and detention centres, as well as what are called \"re-education centres\".\n\nIn response to Iran's violent crackdown on protesters, the UK and other Western countries imposed sanctions on the morality police and other top security figures last year.\n\n(BBC)","title":"Iran's morality police to resume headscarf patrols","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/28955/resume-headscarf-patrols-","video":[]}
