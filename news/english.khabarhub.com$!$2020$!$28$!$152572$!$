$900 bn Covid relief bill\n\nWEST PALM BEACH: \u2013 After delaying for nearly a week and under pressure from all sides, US President Donald Trump finally signed a massive $900 billion stimulus bill, in a long-sought boost for millions of Americans and businesses battered by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe package \u201cproviding coronavirus emergency response and relief\u201d is part of a larger spending bill that, with Trump\u2019s signature, will avoid a government shutdown on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI am signing this bill to restore unemployment benefits, stop evictions, provide rental assistance, add money for PPP (Paycheck Protection Programs), return our airline workers back to work, add substantially more money for vaccine distribution, and much more,\u201d the president said in a statement from his Christmas vacation at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nThe turnaround came after a day marked by calls from all sides of the political spectrum for action to avert an economic and social disaster, especially for America\u2019s vulnerable populations.\n\nTwo federal unemployment benefit programs approved in March as part of an initial Covid-19 relief plan expired at midnight on Saturday, cutting off an estimated 12 million Americans, according to The Century Foundation think tank.\n\nThe relief package, which was first passed by Congress on December 21, extends those benefits as well as others set to expire in the days ahead.\n\nBut for days, Trump had refused to put his signature on it, calling the bill a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and catching both Democrats and Republicans off guard with his complaints, which came after months of negotiations.\n\nInfluential Republican senator Mitt Romney said he was \u201crelieved\u201d at the signing. \u201cHelp is now on the way to workers, families, and small businesses across the country who are desperately in need,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nEarlier Sunday, he had urged Trump to \u201cimmediately sign or veto the COVID-19 relief package so Congress can act before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nIn his statement Sunday, the president continued to push for the $600 direct payments to US taxpayers spelled out in the bill to be more than tripled, and argued the legislation included too much excess spending on unrelated programs.\n\nHe has not said why he waited until the bill was already approved to make his views known.\n\nThe new stimulus package extends federal aid to the unemployed until mid-March, and provides guaranteed loans and billions of dollars in aid to small businesses, restaurants, hotels, airlines and other companies.\n\nIt extends the moratorium on evictions of people unable to pay their rent, suspends foreclosures and provides funds for the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nThe aid is essential to the world\u2019s largest economy, hit hard by restrictions put in place to halt the spread of Covid-19.\n\n\u201cI applaud the President\u2019s decision to get billions of dollars of crucial COVID-19 relief out the door and into the hands of American families,\u201d tweeted Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called the bill \u201ca down payment on what is needed to crush the virus, put money in Americans\u2019 pockets & honor our heroes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must quickly take further action,\u201d she added in a tweet.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Chaos and misery\u2019 \u2013\n\nRomney was not the only politician to have urged the president to change course Sunday.\n\n\u201cI understand he wants to be remembered for advocating for big checks, but the danger is he\u2019ll be remembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior if he allows this to expire,\u201d Republican Senator Pat Toomey told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders said that \u201cwhat the president is doing right now is unbelievably cruel.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany millions of people are losing their extended unemployment benefits,\u201d he said on ABC.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be evicted from their apartments because the eviction moratorium is ending.\u201d\n\nSanders said increased direct payments could be approved in the coming days.\n\nDemocrats in Congress sought Thursday to approve a measure to increase the direct payments in line with what Trump wants, but Republicans blocked it.\n\nIt was seen largely as a theatrical move with little hope of passage designed to expose the rift between Republicans and the outgoing president.
