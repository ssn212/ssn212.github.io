Editor of Toyanath Panta Calendar (Panchanga) Surya Nath Panta told RSS that it was wrong to fix the day time of Chaturthi Tithi (fourth lunar day) Sunday for commencing chariot procession without considering the purity of date, time and horoscopic details. He further clarified that the date and time for auspicious procession should not be allowed as the lunar day falls on the Rikta group and also has the influence of Aswini Nakshyatra. This is not auspicious time since the Sun has separated Rikta Tithi and Aswini Nakshyatra. Astrologer Shiva Pokharel said he has not ever found an epic describing the auspicious date and time for the chariot procession of Rato Machhindranath. However, the date and time for Indrajatra have been found defined in the books including comprehensive code of astronomy. He further said the auspicious time was found to have been fixed for Sunday since there was no explicit documentation determining its date and time. Pokharel said he was also curious why the dates of Saturday or Monday were not given for auspicious work from Tithi perspective. The chariot procession of Rato Machhindranath has been put off due to fear of coronavirus transmission this year. There was a big pressure for continuing with the chariot pulling after the locals hit the street last week demanding for the same even amidst the lockdown enforcement.","title":"Astrologers concern over fixing inauspicious time for Rato Machhindranath chariot pulling","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/15136","video":[]}
