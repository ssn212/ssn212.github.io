The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) on Monday, decided to move the tournament out of Pakistan, claim Indian media. ACC, however, has not said anything officially.\n\nAccording to Indian media, the proposal of the \"Hybrid Model\" brought forth by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has been rejected by ACC.\n\nEarlier, ACC had decided to organize the Asia Cup in Pakistan coming September. However, disputes arose as the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) decided not to send their national team to Pakistan.\n\nPCB proposed the \"Hybrid Model\" after India decided not to send their team to Pakistan, which ACC rejected. It was proposed in the proposal that all the matches would be played in Pakistan, except for the match that India would play, which would be played in some other country (neutral venue).\n\nIndian media like The Indian Express, Inside Sports, India TV, Circle of Cricket, and Press Trust of India (PTI) have claimed that the ACC member states have rejected Pakistan's 'hybrid model'. PCB has not made public its opinion on this matter.\n\nSri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan Cricket Boards have also shown interest in hosting the upcoming Asia Cup. However, ACC has not made any concrete decision on this matter. PCB Chairman Najam Sethi also reached Dubai on Monday to garner support from other ACC member states.","title":"Asia Cup likely to be organized out of Pakistan","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/27680/to-be-organized-out-of-pakistan-","video":[]}
