There was big distance at several places between the source and the processing centre with human settlements in between. Unprocessed water was distributed in few such settlements before this.\n\nKUKL Chief Executive Officer Milan Shakya said the processing centres are being constructed close to the source now for supplying processed water to all places. According to him, a study has been initiated for this purpose in the Kathmandu Valley. KUKL has been distributing water from 35 sources within the Valley. Shakya said the processing centres near water sources would be constructed in coordination with the local levels concerned.\n\nSo far, Tokha Municipality and Budhanilkantha Municipality have agreed to provide land for construction of the water processing plants.
