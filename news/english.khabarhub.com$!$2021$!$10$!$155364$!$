(File Photo)\n\nKATHMANDU: President of Nepali Congress Sher Bahadur Deuba has said that it was inappropriate to speak about the case of House of Representatives (HoR) dissolution as it is under consideration at the Supreme Court.\n\nSpeaking at a program organized by Democratic Thoughts Society to release a book on Surya Prasad Upadhyay on Sunday, former Prime Minister Deuba shared that the NC would accept the court\u2019s verdict.\n\nSaying that the NC has always respected the independent judiciary, he mentioned that the NC was waiting for the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict on the HoR dissolution.\n\nNC President Deuba expressed the view that it was not a right move to take to the street as the case was under consideration at the court.\n\nHe further said that the NC would go for election if the Supreme Court gives its verdict accordingly.\n\nStating that Surya Prasad Upadhyay was one of the four founding leaders of the Nepali Congress, Deuba said that Surya Prasad was highly appreciated politicians among NC leaders and cadres.\n\nSimilarly, NC senior leader Ram Chandra Poudel said that the constitution has no provision to dissolve the HoR while stating that the NC should go for demonstration demanding reinstatement of the HoR.\n\nLeader Poudel opined that there was no alternative to NC to raise voice strongly in favour of HoR reinstatement.\n\nUpadhyay had great contributions in the party and his contributions could not be undermined, he added.\n\nLikewise, NC general secretary Dr Shashank Koirala shared that Upadhyay worked to keep the party alive while NC central committee member Arjun Narsingh KC urged President Deuba to take decision to keep Upadhyay\u2019s photo at party central office and to celebrate Prithvi Jayanti.","title":"Deuba to maintain silence on HoR dissolution case - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2021/10/155364/","video":[]}
