Sale and delivery of food grains, vegetables, milk and dairy products and other essential goods and services will be allowed, and stores selling these items will be opened until 11 in the morning. They were only allowed until 9:15 am earlier.\n\nSimilarly, shops related to construction will be allowed to open from 2-9 pm. Vehicles carrying construction materials will also be allowed into the Valley. They were not allowed earlier.\n\nThe administration also gave permission to educational institutions to conduct online classes. But they should be conducted complying with the safety protocols of the Health Ministry.\n\nThe Valley mayors earlier on Wednesday had called for a week-long curfew in the three districts concluding that the prohibitory orders failed to break the chain of infections. But the CDOs instead decided to relax the prohibitory orders.","title":"Valley mayors unhappy over relaxation of prohibitory orders","url":"http://en.setopati.com/social/153821","video":[]}
