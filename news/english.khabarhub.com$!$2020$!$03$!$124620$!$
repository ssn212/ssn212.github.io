Gautam has been lobbying hard to become a member of the National Assembly.\n\nA Secretariat meeting held on February 26 had recommended Gautam as a member to the National Assembly. However, this decision has not yet been implemented.\n\nMeanwhile, incumbent Finance Minister Yuba Raj Khatiwada\u2019s term is expiring on September 5.\n\nOne who is not a member of parliament can become a minister only for six months as per the existing legal provision. He has to be reappointed as NA lawmaker to continue as the minister.\n\nAccording to a Baluwatar sources, Prime Minister KP Oli is in a mood to give continuity to Khatiwada due to his portfolio-related background and experiences.\n\nBut, at the same time, if Bamdev Gautam is not nominated as the member of National Assembly, he would fall in minority in the party.\n\nPrime Minister Oli, therefore, is in a Hamletian dilemma whether to pick Guatam or Khatiwada.\n\nIt is learnt that Gautam made his intention to become NA lawmaker public recently after sensing Prime Minister Oli was preparing to give continuity to Khatiwada.\n\nPrime Minister Oli and NCP Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal held talks on the agendas of the Secretariat meeting on Wednesday evening.\n\nAccording to sources, Dahal is in favor of Gautam while Oli is in mood of giving continuity to Khatiwada. Gautam had also met with Prime Minister Oli following the meeting with Dahal.\n\nGautam has been demanding with Oli that he be nominated as a National Assembly member and be appointed as Finance Minister.\n\nEven though Oli has been assuring Gautam that he would take him to the House of Representatives by fielding him as a candidate from Dolpa, Gautam has not accepted his proposal.\n\nThe taskforce will also submit the report in the Secretariat meeting today. This is another agenda to be discussed in the meeting today.","title":"NCP Secretariat meet to decide fate of Gautam and Khatiwada today - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/03/124620/","video":[]}
