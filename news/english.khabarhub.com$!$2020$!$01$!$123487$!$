And yet not long ago, there was considerable optimism regarding the country\u2019s economic prospects.\n\nIn 2012, shortly before the start of the economy\u2019s decline, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Article IV assessment cited \u201ca remarkable social transformation in Brazil, underpinned by macroeconomic stability and rising living standards.\u201d\n\nThe IMF projected 4-5% annual GDP growth from 2013 onwards, and financial institutions and media outlets shared its optimism.\n\nBrazil has since become one of the world\u2019s largest food exporters. State-owned Petrobras, now one of the world\u2019s largest oil and gas companies, is a technological leader in deep-water drilling and has transformed Brazil from a net importer of oil to a net exporter.\n\nWhat happened? It\u2019s not that Brazil doesn\u2019t know how to grow. The Growth Commission identified Brazil as one of the few countries able to maintain high growth rates for more than 25 years after World War II.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1980, its economy grew at an average annual rate of 7%, with double-digit manufacturing growth. By the end of that period, Brazil\u2019s manufacturing sector was more advanced than those of South Korea or India in terms of product diversification and sophistication.\n\nWith significant government support, Brazil developed one of the world\u2019s largest aeronautics industries. (The crown jewel of that effort, Embraer, is now a private company.)\n\nSuccessive governments supported the development of local varieties of a wide range of agricultural products, challenging received wisdom regarding the suitability of the country\u2019s soil and climate.\n\nBrazil has since become one of the world\u2019s largest food exporters. State-owned Petrobras, now one of the world\u2019s largest oil and gas companies, is a technological leader in deep-water drilling and has transformed Brazil from a net importer of oil to a net exporter.\n\nWhat, then, explains the country\u2019s post-2013 decline? The conventional answer is fiscal and quasi-fiscal profligacy.\n\nFormer president Dilma Rousseff spent her way to re-election in 2014, disregarding the long-term consequences for government coffers. Fiscal and monetary excesses preceded the 2014 election: delays in adjusting utility tariffs, an artificially overvalued exchange rate, and politically motivated credit expansion via state-owned banks.\n\nThese policies widened the fiscal deficit, fueled inflationary pressure, spooked foreign investors, and put public debt on a dangerous trajectory.\n\nSoon after her victory, Rousseff changed course. Fiscal contraction, tariff adjustments, and higher interest rates triggered a decline in private investment and led to the current collapse in growth.\n\nBut this explanation is far from complete. The causes of Brazil\u2019s economic malaise run deeper than Rousseff\u2019s time in office.\n\nFirst, the country\u2019s growth foundations have weakened since 1980 \u2013 investment has decreased sharply, imports and exports as a share of GDP have declined and manufacturing has plunged from a quarter of GDP to about 10%.\n\nMoreover, investment in infrastructure has declined to below-depreciation levels. With no industrial growth to absorb the labor power released from agriculture, and with formal labor highly taxed, the informal sector has dominated the labor market.\n\nBrazil succumbed to the comfort of rigid rules. Macroeconomic policies were put on autopilot; any bout of inflation was met with interest-rate increases. With an open capital account, financial inflows grew.\n\nWhereas Brazil\u2019s per capita income was twice that of South Korea in 1980, it is now half. Optimistic forecasts by the IMF and others consistently ignored such adverse structural trends.\n\nSecond, Brazil has been successful when implementing its own policy solutions. It ended high inflation in 1994 through the \u201cPlano Real,\u201d a stabilization plan based on the insight that the inflation index itself could become the unit of account, and thus the basis for a stable currency.\n\nThis unorthodox plan, which the IMF declined to support, brought inflation down to single digits without the growth slowdown that typically accompanies stabilization.\n\nA few years later, Brazil resisted \u201cdollarization\u201d pressure from the IMF, the United States, and financial investors.\n\nInstead, it addressed the financial instability brought about by the 1997 East Asian crisis by introducing the \u201ctriad\u201d: a commitment to primary fiscal surpluses (achieved through significant tax increases), a floating exchange rate, and central-bank independence with the sole objective of targeting inflation.\n\nThe triad was successful at containing inflation and stabilizing financial flows. But good policies seldom remain so forever.\n\nBrazil succumbed to the comfort of rigid rules. Macroeconomic policies were put on autopilot; any bout of inflation was met with interest-rate increases. With an open capital account, financial inflows grew.\n\nAnd the exchange rate was left to appreciate regardless of the consequences for exports or the real economy.\n\nThe \u201ctriad\u201d policies were maintained long after they had stopped being useful. Interest rates, the world\u2019s highest in real terms, have sustained an overvalued exchange rate, undercut exports, and made interest payments on public debt (which otherwise would have been manageable) Brazil\u2019s largest fiscal-expenditure item (up to 8% in recent years).\n\nBut neither is responsible for Brazil\u2019s weakened growth foundations, the lack of a development strategy, imprudent \u201cimported\u201d policy ideas, and rigid macroeconomic rules. Addressing these shortcomings will be the key to long-term prosperity.\n\nThen, during Rousseff\u2019s second term, just as the commodity boom was ending, the government lowered utility subsidies, cut expenditure, and increased real interest rates to several times the economy\u2019s growth rate.\n\nEconomic contraction accelerated and unemployment increased. After Rousseff\u2019s impeachment in 2016, the government reinforced expenditure cuts, again without a growth strategy. Declines in GDP meant lower tax revenues and increased public debt.\n\nApplauded by the IMF, the World Bank, and the international and domestic financial press, the authorities persisted with austerity, persuaded that fiscal contraction was expansionary, even in the midst of a recession, because, by reducing expected future taxation, it would encourage entrepreneurs to increase their present investments.\n\nBut it is counterintuitive to expect entrepreneurs with existing idle capacity to expand such capacity even further.\n\nRousseff may have worsened Brazil\u2019s economic travails during her 2014 presidential campaign, and they have certainly been exacerbated by COVID-19.\n\nBut neither is responsible for Brazil\u2019s weakened growth foundations, the lack of a development strategy, imprudent \u201cimported\u201d policy ideas, and rigid macroeconomic rules. Addressing these shortcomings will be the key to long-term prosperity.\n\n(Carlos Antonio Luque is Professor of Economics at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.
