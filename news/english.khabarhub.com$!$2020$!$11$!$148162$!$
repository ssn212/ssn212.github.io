Dr Prabin Nepal of the Armed Police Force (APF) Hospital also said the number of people recovered has increased as the rate of infection has been found lower due to the less number of tests.\n\nDeath rate also lower Likewise, the rate of death from COVID-19 in Nepal is less compared to the global rate.\n\nThe latest statistics show that 0.67 per cent of the total infected have died in Nepal.\n\nThe mortality rate is 56.5 per one million. One thousand six hundred and sixty-three people have died of coronavirus infection in Nepal so far.\n\nThe global death rate from coronavirus infection is 2.3 per cent.
