But many believe his arrival is connected to the party\u2019s pursuit of power.\n\nThaksin flew from Singapore in his private jet and landed at Don Mueang International Airport around 9 a.m. local time. Thai broadcasters aired live footage of him walking out of the airport\u2019s private jet terminal with his daughter, key Pheu Thai member Paetongtarn Shinawatra, and greeting his supporters.\n\nAfter walking out, Thaksin placed a flower wreath and prostrated before a portrait of Thailand\u2019s king and queen at the gate of the terminal.\n\nSupporters of him gathered outside of the airport hours ahead of his arrival, donning red and holding sign with welcoming messages. Core members of the Pheu Thai party were also seen at the airport.\n\nThe 74-year-old billionaire promoted populist policies and used his telecommunications fortune to build his own Thai Rak Thai party and be elected prime minister in 2001 and easily reelected in 2005, before being ousted in a military coup in 2006 and fleeing into exile.\n\nThaksin was convicted in absentia in several criminal cases that he said were politically motivated, and he could face prison time unless he receives a royal pardon.\n\nPheu Thai is the latest in a string of parties affiliated with Thaksin. The military coup that ousted him triggered years of upheaval and division that pitted a mostly poor, rural majority in the north that supports Thaksin against royalists, the military and their urban backers.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Thai on Saturday, Thaksin said his return was planned before the date of the parliamentary vote was set, and that he was prepared to follow the Thai legal process.\n\nLess than a week before May elections, Thaksin announced he would like to return before his birthday in July, but the plan was repeatedly delayed, with he and Paetongtarn citing both post-election uncertainties and his health.\n\nPheu Thai came in second in the elections but took over leadership in forming a new government after the surprise winner, the progressive Move Forward Party, was repeatedly rejected by conservative senators appointed by a previous military government.\n\nMove Forward\u2019s reform agenda appealed deeply to many Thais, particularly younger voters who were disenchanted by 17 years of military-backed rule, but was seen as a threat by the country\u2019s conservative elites.\n\nAfter more than three months without a new government, Parliament plans to vote Tuesday afternoon on Pheu Thai\u2019s candidate for prime minister, former property developer Srettha Thavisin, after it formed an 11-party coalition including two parties allied with its former military adversaries. Pheu Thai has been heavily criticized by some of its supporters for backtracking on a pre-election pledge not to join hands with pro-military parties.\n\nPheu Thai officials have defended the decision by saying it was necessary to break the political deadlock and seek reconciliation after decades of deep political divisions.\n\n\u201cAlthough there are parties from the outgoing government in the coalition, all parties will work with Pheu Thai with efficiency and serve the best interests of the public,\u201d Pheu Thai leader Chonlanan Srikaew said Monday. \u201cThe coalition parties will use this chance as a beginning to build love, harmony and reconciliation of the people in the country, and will work together to create prosperity for the country and the people into the future.\u201d\n\nThe Pheu Thai-led coalition holds 314 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives and needs some support from the non-elected Senate, appointed by a previous military government, to achieve a majority in the combined parliamentary vote.\n\nBoth houses of Parliament vote together for the prime minister under the military-implemented constitution, in an arrangement designed to protect conservative military-backed rule. Senators, like the army, see themselves as guardians of traditional conservative royalist values.\n\nThaksin came back briefly to Thailand in 2008 to face a court trial before fleeing the country. He has avoided returning over concerns he would not be treated fairly by the military-backed government and establishment that has long held a sharp animosity toward him.\n\nHe has remained active in Thai politics, however, often making video calls to political rallies of parties backed by him.\n\n\u201cThaksin\u2019s plans to return to Thailand were postponed after the election results were announced \u2014 this implies a strong connection between the election, formation of coalitions, and selection of the prime minister on one hand, and Thaksin\u2019s personal agenda on the other,\u201d said Napon Jatusripitak, a political science researcher and visiting fellow at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.\n\n\u201cThaksin has managed to make this election about himself personally, and the direction of a Pheu Thai-led coalition heavily depends on his personal whims.\u201d\n\nWith the convictions against him, Thaksin could face more than a decade in prison, though Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam of the outgoing military-linked government said earlier that Thaksin is eligible to request a pardon and could receive special treatment because of his age.\n\nNapon said Thaksin\u2019s decision to return now suggests that \u201che has received assurances that he will not have to serve a prison sentence in full.\u201d\n\n","title":"Thai ex-Prime Minister Thaksin returns from exile as party seeks to form new government","url":"http://en.setopati.com/International/161615","video":[]}
