In 2019, tourism generated an estimated $2.05 billion, which accounted for 6.7% of gross domestic product. TIA in Kathmandu is the country\u2019s only international airport and a major hub for domestic air transport. GBA in Lumbini will serve as an alternate international air transport facility for Nepal. Lumbini is the birthplace of the Buddha and is a pilgrimage and major tourist destination.\n\n\u201cADB\u2019s support will improve the TIA\u2019s safety, capacity, and operational efficiency. In addition, the new GBA international terminal will play a key role in boosting regional tourism in and around Lumbini,\u201d said ADB Senior Transport\n\nSpecialist for South Asia Kai Wei Yeo. \u201cThe project will help revive the country\u2019s tourism industry and address the long-term negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe loan will support the construction of a parallel taxiway extension and hangar aprons at TIA, and a new international terminal building at GBA to increase capacity.\n\nAnother key component of the project is minimizing climate change impacts. This will be carried out by using clean energy materials, such as solar panels and energy-efficient lighting to be installed at the new GBA terminal building.","title":"ADB approves concessional loan of Rs 17.7 billion to improve two airports' capacity - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/20/143342/","video":[]}
