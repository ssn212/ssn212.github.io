Ltd., the authorized distributors of DFSK vehicles in Nepal, is planning to introduce Yadea e-Scooters in Nepal. Moreover, the company plans to mark the entry with two e-Scooters \u2013 Yadea C1S, and Yadea G5, and one e-Bike \u2013 Yadea e-MTB.\n\nThese new e-Scooters are expected to bring better design, better technology, and better features.\n\nSo, who is Yadea?\n\nYadea is a popular e-Scooter brand, with a global presence across 83 countries. The company has been leading the sales chart for 15 consecutive years. The company reported annuals sales of 60 Lakhs units just in 2019!\n\nFurthermore, Yadea became the first electric two-wheeler company in China to be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\n\nYadea e-Scooters in Nepal\n\nYadea will make its debut with two e-Scooters: Yadea C1S and Yadea G5. Additionally, both electric two-wheelers will feature a unique design, premium features, and a powerful motor.\n\nInterestingly, both Yadea C1S and Yadea G5 have a futuristic look to it.\n\nYadea C1S\n\nYadea C1S is powered by a GTR 3.0 electromotor, backed up by a 32Ah 60V Lithium battery. It can generate a max power of 3500W and a top speed torque of 138Nm.\n\nC1S claims a top speed of 60 Kmph alongside a total range of 80Km. Depending on the type of charger, the average charging time varies from 3.5hrs to 8.5 hrs.\n\nALSO READ: All-new Sporty Yamaha Ray ZR 125 with FI and BS6 Engine Coming in Nepal Soon\n\nIt also features a 25-liter storage capacity, 180mm ground clearance, dual-disc brakes, keyless unlock, Eco mode, and so much more!\n\nYadea G5\n\nSimilarly, Yadea G5 is powered by a GTR 3.0 electromotor, backed up by a 32Ah 60V Lithium battery. It can generate a max power of 2300W and a top speed torque of 120Nm.\n\nG5 claims a top speed of 50-55 Kmph alongside a total range of 50-55Km. Depending on the type of charger, the average charging time varies from 3.5hrs to 8.5 hrs.\n\nIt also features an IP57 waterproof rating, 180mm ground clearance, dual-disc brakes, Eco mode, and so much more!\n\nYadea Electric Scooter Price in Nepal and Availability\n\nIn addition to the two e-Scooter, Yadea is also set to launch an e-Bike, Yadea e-MTB.\n\nBesides the confirmation on the upcoming models, we\u2019re still short on other details like pricing and launch.\n\nWith the festival season approaching, it seems more than likely that Yadea e-Scooter will make their debut during that time frame. So, I\u2019d say that it would be a safe guess to expect launch after roughly two or three months.\n\nAs for the pricing, we aren\u2019t so sure about that either.\n\nEspecially since the Government\u2019s decision to put the tax on electric vehicles, many companies are reluctant to launch new electric in Nepal. It will be interesting to see how this entire thing plays out.\n\nIn any case, Yadea is coming soon in Nepal. When we do get more information about the pricing, we\u2019ll be sure to let you know too.\n\nOn a separate note, Yadea e-Scooters are expected to head-on against the likes of NIU e-Scooters. That\u2019s the one battle I\u2019m very much invested in!\n\nREAD NEXT: Yamaha Fascino 125 FI First Ride: Refined BS6 Engine and New Practical Features","title":"Yadea, A Premium Electric Scooter Brand, to Enter in Nepal Soon","url":"http://techlekh.com/yadea-electric-scooters-nepal-launch/","video":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/UdUPHWKBB-w?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent"]}
