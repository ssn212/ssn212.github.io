The NRA responsibility was transferred to the Local Infrastructure Development Office, Kaski under the Urban Development Ministry.\n\nProject engineer Bibek Poudel informed that blacktopping has started after completion of the tasks related to road expansion, drainage and wall construction, placement of base and sub-base.\n\n'Placement of prime board is taking place on the Khiwang-Shikh road section. It would then be done on Dhar section and Falate-Chitre section', he said, adding, 'the task of blacktopping would be done adopting DBSD technology'.\n\nThe project that was signed almost three years ago has witnessed good progress and is completing soon. The blacktopping has kept their hope alive that the road construction would be completed, said Suren Gurung, a local of Shikh. The road would ease the movement of around 2,500 households of Shikh and Dhar and hundreds of tourists coming to the areas every day.\n\nThe Pokahrebagar-Chitre road which is considered the pride project of Myagdi is equally important for agriculture and tourism besides transport service.\n\nAnnapurna Chair Dam Bahadur Pun said the up-gradation of the road would believably promote local market and tourism in the area.","title":"Pokharebagar-Chitre road being blacktopped","url":"http://english.lokaantar.com/news/detail/33243","video":[]}
