They all have found jobs.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese government has detained an estimated 1 million or more members of ethnic Turkic minorities in Xinjiang, holding them in internment camps and prisons where they are subjected to ideological discipline, forced to denounce their religion and language and physically abused. China has long suspected the Uighurs, who are mostly Muslim, of harboring separatist tendencies because of their distinct culture, language and religion.\n\nAsked about Hong Kong\u2019s security law, Wang said, \u201cWe certainly couldn\u2019t sit idly by and let the chaos go on, so we enacted a law maintaining national security that specifically suited Hong Kong\u2019s situation.\u201d\n\nThe law is seen by many as Beijing\u2019s boldest move yet to break down legal barriers between the semi-autonomous territory of Hong Kong and the mainland\u2019s authoritarian Communist Party system.\n\nWang called both issues internal Chinese affairs and said foreign powers shouldn\u2019t interfere.\n\nAt a meeting Friday with Wang, French President Emmanuel Macron expressed \u201chis strong concern about the situation in Hong Kong, and around human rights, notably the Uighurs, and the need for China to respect its international commitments,\u201d according to Macron\u2019s office.\n\nForeign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian raised similar concerns, as did officials on other legs of Wang\u2019s Europe trip, which includes Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Germany.\n\nHis visit also included discussion of trade, fighting climate change and other issues where Europe depends on China because of its huge global influence.","title":"Chinese Foreign Minister defends Xinjiang detention camps and Hong Kong security law","url":"http://en.setopati.com/political/153795","video":[]}
