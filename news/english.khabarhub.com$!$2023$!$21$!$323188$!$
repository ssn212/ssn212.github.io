Liquor products, in particular, can contribute to various cancer risks including liver, throat, stomach, breast, and intestine cancers.\n\nDr. Shah also highlights the health risks associated with excessive intake of red meat and sugary foods, which can increase the risk of colon cancer. Grilled meat, due to the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, is linked to an increased risk of stomach cancer.\n\nDr. Shankar Laudari, a cardiologist at Chitwan Heart Hospital, recommends a daily meat intake of just 50-70 grams per person. Consuming more than 150 grams of meat per day can lead to a 15 percent higher chance of suffering a heart attack, according to the doctor.\n\nMoreover, regular meat consumption is associated with a higher risk of diabetes and high blood pressure. \u201cTo mitigate these risks, it is advisable to remove fat and skin from meat before cooking and prepare it with minimal oil, spices, and salt. Chicken is a better choice compared to mutton, and fish is recommended over red meat,\u201d Laudari added.\n\nSenior physician Dr. Bhojraj Adhikari advises the public for maintaining a balanced diet during the festival season, urging them to avoid red meat when possible. \u201cSkinless meat is a good source of protein and is healthier. Excessive use of salt, oil, and spices to enhance the taste of meat is discouraged from a medical perspective.\u201d\n\nIt is worth noting that frozen meat, as well as grilled, fried, and dried meats, are not considered healthy options.\n\nFresh meat should be prepared with minimal salt, oil, and spices. Combining meat consumption with beverages and smoking poses greater health risks. A better approach is to include fruits and vegetables along with meat products for a more balanced and health-conscious diet, doctors recommend.\n\nRSS","title":"Doctors recommend healthy foods with limited intake of meat products, sugary items during Dashain","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/21/323188/","video":[]}
