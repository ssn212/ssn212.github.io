Her predecessor, Yoel Roth, left in November 2022 - a month after Mr Musk took control.\n\nThe head of trust and safety is tasked with content moderation, a topic that has come under the spotlight since the takeover.\n\nAlthough Irwin has not publicly said why she left Twitter, her exit came a day after Musk publicly criticised a content moderation decision.\n\nHe called the decision to limit the visibility of a video over allegations of misgendering, \"a mistake by many people at Twitter\".\n\n\"Whether or not you agree with using someone's preferred pronouns, not doing so is at most rude and certainly breaks no laws,\" he wrote.\n\nJust days later, Linda Yaccarino, the former head of advertising at NBCUniversal, took up her role as Twitter's chief executive, replacing Musk.\n\nIrwin's resignation also came a week after the social media platform pulled out of the European Union's voluntary code to fight disinformation.\n\nSince buying Twitter, Musk has cut about 75% of its employees, including teams charged with tracking abuse, and changed how the company's verification process.\n\nMeanwhile, advertisers have left in large numbers.\n\nIn her former role, Yaccarino is credited with helping to steer NBCUniversal through the upheaval caused by technology firms, overhauling advertising sales, and driving industry-wide debates about data gaps as audiences migrate online.\n\n(BBC)","title":"Australia issues warning to Twitter over online hate","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/28435/warning-to-twitter-over-online-hate-","video":[]}
