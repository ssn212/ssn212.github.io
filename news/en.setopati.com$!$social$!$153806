Unemployment is soaring, with millions left jobless. Hoping to avoid more economic damage, India is gradually relaxing restrictions and has announced that urban metro trains can resume service next Monday.\n\nIndia has been reporting the highest single-day caseload in the world for nearly three weeks. On Tuesday it recorded 69,921 new coronavirus infections. More than 65,000 people have died.\n\nExperts say India, the world\u2019s third most affected country, is fast becoming the new coronavirus epicenter and its case total is likely to soon pass Brazil and ultimately the United States.\n\nMost of India\u2019s cases are in western Maharashtra state and the four southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka, but new surges are being recorded in the country\u2019s vast hinterlands, overwhelming the poorly equipped healthcare system. In poorer states, the federal government has deployed special teams to monitor the situation.\n\n\u201cThis was to be expected,\u201d said Dr. Gagandeep Kang, an infectious diseases expert at the Christian Medical College at Vellore in southern India. \u201cIt was inevitable that the numbers would climb.\u201d\n\nIndian authorities have pointed to the recovery rate of virus patients in the country, now at more than 76%, as evidence of the success of its policy. India is also doing more tests \u2014 nearly 100,000 per day \u2014 but its testing rate at around 32,000 per million is still far lower than in the U.S.\n\nKang said insufficient data still hampers public health efforts.\n\n\u201cA case becomes a case because you detected an infection. It doesn\u2019t actually tell you about the disease,\u201d said Kang. \u201cWhat we really need to be concerned about is the disease, whom is it affecting and how are we handling it.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s initial strategy in controlling the virus was an abrupt, risky gamble: the lockdown of its entire population of 1.4 billion people at the cost of hollowing out its economy.\n\nIt worked for some time. While other large countries struggled with the pandemic, India\u2019s cases remained low, although testing was limited.\n\nThe general sense of a looming health crisis in March and April was largely missing. By May and June, cases began to gradually increase, with megacity Mumbai and the capital, New Delhi, faring the worst.\n\nThe virus has now spread even to remote areas such as the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where members of a tribe tested positive last week.\n\nSome government decisions to reopen the economy and society have met sharp criticism.\n\nOn Tuesday, India held competitive college exams despite demands from students that they be postponed because of the pandemic. Students and many opposition parties say they fear the exams will result in a surge in infections. The exams were earlier postponed twice.","title":"India eases restrictions as cases near 3.7 million","url":"http://en.setopati.com/social/153806","video":[]}
