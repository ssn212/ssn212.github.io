Now more than ever, it is important to strengthen strategic partnerships across the industry to optimise our operations and provide seamless connectivity to hundreds of destinations across the globe for our passengers. Since 2000, both airlines have seen the benefits that commercial cooperation has brought, providing our passengers with unrivalled service and more flexibility to travel when they want. I look forward to further strengthening our commercial cooperation with Oman Air to provide even more benefits to our customers.\u201d\n\nOman Air Chief Executive Officer Abdulaziz Al Raisi, said: \u201cWe are delighted to expand our commercial cooperation with Qatar Airways, which will streamline flying for leisure travellers from around the world to enjoy Oman\u2019s culture, scenic beauty and hospitality, and facilitate travel for those who visit the Sultanate of Oman for abundant, fast-growing business opportunities across a diverse range of sectors. The expansion of our code-share agreement is just the first step, and we look forward to working with Qatar Airways to further strengthen our strategic partnership to enhance the business and leisure travel experience for our customers in Oman and throughout the world.\u201d\n\nThe code-share expansion will significantly increase the number of destinations available to Oman Air passengers from three to 65* on the Qatar Airways\u2019 network across Africa, the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, India, and the Middle East.\n\nQatar Airways passengers will also benefit from additional connectivity, with the ability to book travel on an additional six destinations across Africa and Asia in Oman Air\u2019s network.\n\nBoth airlines will also explore a number of joint commercial and operational initiatives to further optimise their partnership.\n\nQatar Airways\u2019 strategic investment in a variety of fuel-efficient, twin-engine aircraft, including the largest fleet of Airbus A350 aircraft, has enabled it to continue flying throughout this crisis and perfectly positions it to lead the sustainable recovery of international travel.\n\nThe airline recently took delivery of three new state-of-the-art Airbus A350-1000 aircraft, increasing its total A350 fleet to 52 with an average age of just 2.6 years.\n\nDue to COVID-19\u2019s impact on travel demand, the airline has grounded its fleet of Airbus A380s as it is not environmentally justifiable to operate such a large, four-engine aircraft in the current market.\n\nQatar Airways has also recently launched a new program that enables passengers to voluntarily offset the carbon emissions associated with their journey at the point of booking.\n\nThe national carrier of the State of Qatar continues to rebuild its network, which currently stands at over 110 destinations with plans to increase to 129 by the end of March 2021.\n\nA multiple award-winning airline, Qatar Airways was named \u2018World\u2019s Best Airline\u2019 by the 2019 World Airline Awards, managed by Skytrax. It was also named \u2018Best Airline in the Middle East\u2019, \u2018World\u2019s Best Business Class\u2019, and \u2018Best Business Class Seat\u2019, in recognition of its ground-breaking Business Class experience, Qsuite.\n\nThe Qsuite seat layout is a 1-2-1 configuration, providing passengers with the most spacious, fully private, comfortable and social distanced Business Class product in the sky. It is the only airline to have been awarded the coveted \u2018Skytrax Airline of the Year\u2019 title, which is recognised as the pinnacle of excellence in the airline industry, five times.\n\n(* Subject to regulatory approval)","title":"Qatar Airways and Oman Air agree on Code-share Expansion - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/30/152918/","video":[]}
