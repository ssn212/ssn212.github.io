It was not immediately clear where the protests would be held.\n\nFor the last two months, farmer unions have rejected the laws, which were passed in September, and have camped on highways in Punjab and Haryana states. They say the measure could cause the government to stop buying grain at guaranteed prices and result in their being exploited by corporations that would buy their crops at cheap prices.\n\nThe government says the laws are needed to reform agriculture by giving farmers the freedom to market their produce and boosting production through private investment.\n\nThe farmers began their march to the capital on Thursday to pressure Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government to abolish the laws, but were stopped by large numbers of security personnel in riot gear on the boundary between New Delhi and Haryana state.\n\nThey resumed their march early Friday, unfazed by overnight rain and chilly winter temperatures.\n\nHeading toward New Delhi on tractors and cars, the farmers were again blocked by police at the capital\u2019s fringes. This led to clashes with police, who used tear gas, water cannons and baton charges to push them back.\n\nIn response, farmers used tractors to clear walls of concrete, shipping containers and parked trucks set up by police on roads leading to the capital.\n\nSome protesters also threw stones at officers and waved the flags of farmer unions. There were no immediate reports of injuries.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting for our rights. We won\u2019t rest until we reach the capital and force the government to abolish these black laws,\u201d said Majhinder Singh Dhaliwal, a farmer leader.\n\nEarlier, in a bid to stop the protesters from riding commuter trains into the capital, the Delhi Metro suspended some services. Traffic slowed to a crawl as vehicles were checked along state boundaries, leading to huge jams on some highways.\n\nPunjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh urged the federal government to initiate talks with protest leaders. Many of the farmers are from Punjab, one of the largest agricultural states in India.\n\n\u201cThe voice of farmers cannot be muzzled indefinitely,\u201d Singh wrote on Twitter.\n\nNegotiations between the leaders of farmer unions and the government to defuse the standoff have been unsuccessful. Farmers say they will continue to protest until the government rolls back the laws.\n\nOpposition parties and some Modi allies have called the laws anti-farmer and pro-corporation.\n\nFarmers have long been seen as the heart and soul of India, where agriculture supports more than half of the country\u2019s 1.3 billion people. But farmers have also seen their economic clout diminish over the last three decades. Once accounting for a third of India\u2019s gross domestic product, they now produce only 15% of the country\u2019s $2.9 trillion economy.\n\nFarmers often complain of being ignored and hold frequent protests to demand better crop prices, more loan waivers and irrigation systems to guarantee water during dry spells.","title":"Indian police agree to allow protesting farmers into capital","url":"http://en.setopati.com/social/154467","video":[]}
