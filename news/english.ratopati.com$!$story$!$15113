The community has come up with a protocol to be observed during the festival, that is knocking the door. The Tharu community leaders met through a virtual meeting on Saturday to come up with a protocol for the festival, said Tharu Kalyankari Sabha Chitwan Chair Lalit Kumar Chaudhary.\n\nThe protocol was felt necessary considering the risk of Corona Virus pandemic. The festival is normally celebrated collectively with all the relatives coming together. The Tharu community observes the festival every year on Bhadra Krishna Astami. Group dance and collective pooja is another feature of the festival.\n\nThe protocol bars any activity that is carried out in group. It encourages all to observe the festival by limiting themselves within their own family members, said Chair of Tharu Sanskriti Sabha Kaman Singh Chaudhary. The protocol shall also apply to the upcoming festivals including Amosa, Soharai, Chhath, Badka Ekadashi among others. The Tharu community is the major indigenous group of Chitwan.","title":"Tharu community comes up with protocol to celebrate Jitiya","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/15113","video":[]}
