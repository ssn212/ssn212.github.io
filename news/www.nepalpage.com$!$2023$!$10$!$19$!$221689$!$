Entire families were executed in their homes, and over 260 were slaughtered at an outdoor festival, many amid horrific acts of brutality by the terrorists, in what Biden has highlighted as \u201cthe worst massacre of the Jewish people since the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nIsrael had bombed the Rafah crossing to prevent all entry of materials shortly after the war broke out.\n\nBiden\u2019s wartime visit to Israel Wednesday was aimed at showing support and also securing humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian enclave, ruled by the Hamas terror group.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s office said Israel \u201cwill not thwart\u201d deliveries of food, water or medicine from Egypt, as long as they are limited to civilians in the south of the Gaza Strip and don\u2019t go to Hamas terrorists. Netanyahu also vowed not to let any aid into the Strip through Israel\u2019s crossings.\n\nBiden warned that \u201cif Hamas confiscates it, doesn\u2019t let it get through \u2026 then it\u2019s going to end,\u201d he said. The aid will start moving Friday at the earliest, White House officials said.\n\nBiden clarified that people will not be able to evacuate Gaza through Rafah, apparently in order to assuage fears in Cairo that Egypt will be asked to take in refugees from Gaza.\n\nBiden said he thought he\u2019s have to spend more time trying to convince Sissi but he \u201cstepped up as did Bibi [Netanyahu],\u201d Biden told reporters.\n\n\u201cIsrael has been badly victimized, but, you know, the truth is that if they have an opportunity to relieve suffering of people who are \u2014 have nowhere to go\u2026 it\u2019s what they should do. And if they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll be held accountable in ways that may be unfair,\u201d he said, adding that he was \u201cvery blunt with the Israelis in talks Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIf you have an opportunity to alleviate the pain, you should do it. Period. And if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to lose credibility worldwide,\u201d he said.\n\nRelatives of some of the roughly 200 people who were taken hostage and forced into Gaza during the attack reacted with fury to the aid announcement.\n\n\u201cChildren, infants, women, soldiers, men, and elderly, some with serious illnesses, wounded and shot, are held underground like animals,\u201d said a statement from the Hostage and Missing Families Forum. But \u201cthe Israeli government pampers the murderers and kidnappers.\u201d\n\nThe UN earlier today said that roughly 100 trucks of aid per day will be needed to rehabilitate Gaza following the Israeli counter-attacks.","title":"Biden praises Netanyahu, Sissi on Gaza humanitarian aid deal: They \u2018stepped up\u2019","url":"http://www.nepalpage.com/2023/10/19/221689/","video":[]}
