Oppo has launched 3 smartphones in the past months including the Oppo A52. And, the all-new Oppo A53 sounds like a direct upgrade of the Oppo A52 but doesn\u2019t look so on paper.\n\nOppo A53 is set to launch within this month in two colors: Fancy Blue and Electric Black. Though it has two variants, Nepal will only get the 4GB RAM and 64GB storage variant.\n\nIt comes with a 90Hz refresh rate display but what else do we get with it?

One of the striking differences is the fingerprint sensor on the rear. It has a plastic back along with a plastic frame and Oppo is calling it a 3D-curved Iridescent Wave design.\n\nOn the front, it has a hole-punch on the left.\n\nDisplay\n\nNow the interesting thing is its display. Oppo calls it a 90Hz Neo-Display that offers a 90Hz refresh rate for a smooth viewing experience. However, it\u2019s a 6.5 inches 720p IPS LCD display with a screen resolution of 720 x 1600 pixels.\n\nThe screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 3.\n\nALSO READ: Oppo Mobiles Price in Nepal: Features and Specs\n\nHardware\n\nOppo A53 is running on Snapdragon 460 chipset. It has Octa-core (4\u00d71.8 GHz Kryo 240 & 4\u00d71.6 GHz Kryo 240) CPU and Adreno 610 GPU. Along with this, it comes with 4GB RAM and 64GB UFS 2.1 storage.\n\nSnapdragon 460 SoC is built with an 11nm process and features Kyro 240 performance cores. And, it also has Adreno 610 GPU which is supposed to provide a 60% better performance than any other Snapdragon 400 series SoC.\n\nCamera\n\nOppo A53 has a triple camera setup on the rear with a 13MP main sensor, a 2MP depth sensor, and a 2MP macro sensor.\n\nOn the front, it has a 16MP selfie camera. You can capture 1080p 30fps videos from both the front and rear cameras.\n\nBattery\n\nIt comes with a 5000 mAh battery along with an 18W fast charger. The battery should be more than enough for a day. And the 18W charger is quite good.\n\nFurthermore, it runs on ColorOS 7.2 on top of Android 10.\n\nOppo A53 Price in Nepal and Availability\n\nOppo A53 costs INR 13,000 in India for the 4/64GB variant which is approx NPR 20,852. So, we expect the Oppo A53 price in Nepal to be around Rs. 26,000. It will be launched within this month and will be available in two colors: Fancy Blue and Electric Black.\n\nOppo A53\u2019s main highlight is a 90Hz refresh rate display but it\u2019s only a 720p display. While it\u2019s exciting to get a 90Hz display, I think people would have been happier with a 1080p 60Hz display than a 720p 90Hz display. However, its Snapdragon 460 processor will perform better on a 720p display.\n\nALSO READ: OPPO A52 with Stereo Speakers and Snapdragon 665 Launched in Nepal\n\nComing to the performance, the Snapdragon 460 is a downgrade to the Snapdragon 665 used on the Oppo A52. Though they use the same GPU, Snapdragon 665 has Kryo 260 Gold & 260 Silver cores compared to Kryo 240 cores of the Snapdragon 460. On top of this, It lacks an ultrawide angle sensor.\n\nSo, Oppo A53 is not looking like a great budget phone. But, we\u2019ll see how good it is after it\u2019s launch.\n\nWhat do you think of the Oppo A53? Would you like a 90Hz 720p display or a 1080p 60Hz display?\n\nAlso, watch our video of the best phones under Rs. 30,000 in Nepal.","title":"Oppo A53 with 90Hz Refresh Rate 720p Display to Launch in Nepal","url":"http://techlekh.com/oppo-a53-price-nepal/","video":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/c9JNjFzQaSo?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent"]}
