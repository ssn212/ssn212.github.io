Is the paradigm shift possible?\n\nShaming slow learners on the basis of exam results can affect their psychology. Photo: Pexels\n\nOn April 18, poet and director Upendra Subba wrote something on his Facebook page that created a buzz among social media users in Nepal. He said how his daughter, a ninth grader at DAV Sushil Kedia Vishwa Bharati School, was humiliated by the school authorities after she failed her examinations. According to him, the school insulted and humiliated the child and the guardian.\n\nRepresenting thousands of guardians of slow learners in Nepal, he wrote, \u201cThe vice principal and two other people insulted and humiliated my daughter and wife saying, \u2018We (the school) can\u2019t teach this kid. Take her to another school, there is no medicine to teach her.\u2019 \u2018She can\u2019t study. She can\u2019t do anything by studying, instead, buy her a scooter and make her a Pathao rider.\u2019 Afterwards, the mother and daughter came crying to me.\u201d\n\nFollowing the incident, the school received flak from thousands of people, but it did not change anything to the situation. When Onlinekhabar tried to get the school\u2019s comment, no one responded.\n\nBut Subba\u2019s daughter is not an isolated case; there could be thousands of slow learners facing similar situations. The fact that a reputed school like DAV is engaging in such unfair practices towards underperforming students raises the concern that many other schools may also mistreat students who do not perform well on exams.\n\nThe systematic flaw\n\nRepresentational image\n\nStakeholders say this is one of several flaws plaguing the education system in Nepal. Shaming slow learners on the basis of exam results can affect their psychology. Children who are humiliated for failing exams may also develop a fear of failure, which can prevent them from taking risks and trying new things in the future. Similarly, it can also lead to anxiety, depression and even suicidal thoughts in some cases.\n\n\u201cUnder the pretext of making students disciplined and sincere towards their studies, schools can\u2019t humiliate and punish anyone,\u201d says Suprabhat Bhandari, the president of Nepal Guardian Federation, an organisation of guardians. \u201cDoing so would not only affects their psychology but also violate the law.\u201d\n\nAccording to Nancy Flanagan, an education writer, students who are shamed repeatedly often respond by shutting down, avoiding the mortification of being unable to perform or behave in socially acceptable ways.\n\nReportedly, if a student becomes too fearful of being humiliated and as a result, stops answering questions in class or avoids attempting anything, the teacher\u2019s actions have the potential to harm the student\u2019s academic growth and development.\n\nInstead of humiliating slow learners, teachers should look out for other ways that would encourage them to progress, experts say.\n\nTime for change\n\nTeachers should explore students\u2019 interests and give priority to them first to improve the studies of slow learners.\n\nTherefore, stakeholders say it is high time the concerned bodies and stakeholders thought about healthy ways to deal with slow learners. Now, they should realise that shaming and humiliating students do not provide answers.\n\nMost commonly in Nepali schools, every student is taught in similar ways whether they are sharp or slow learners. The only extra thing they do with slow learners is to put them into extra classes. This practice has been running for a very long in Nepali schools, but does this really work?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d says educationist Bidya Nath Koirala. \u201cThe extra classes have been just a medium to earn money for schools,\u201d he says.\n\nAdditionally, those extra classes are exactly as similar to the regular classes. They do not hold any special effort to help them improve their studies.\n\nBhandari considers those extra classes as a fashion in the education system. Extra classes should be occasional; they should be held only in a very necessary condition. \u201cRunning them regularly is unscientific and unproductive. Those occasional extra classes should also be conducted only for secondary-level students,\u201d says Bhandari.\n\nTo make the classes effective for slow learners, Koirala suggests the schools should first run the basic teaching. Then, the teachers should identify students\u2019 strengths and weaknesses and teach again accordingly.\n\nEvery student is different and has a different approach to understanding the content, so teaching everyone in a similar style will not be effective. \u201cThe students also need to openly tell their problems and confusion to the teachers. Parents are also equally responsible for it,\u201d says Koirala.\n\nBhandari adds that teachers should explore their interests and give priority to them first to improve the studies of slow learners. He adds, \u201cThe teacher also needs to put effort into exploring the factors that are weakening their education.\u201d\n\nAre the schools ready?\n\nIllustration for representation only\n\nDK Dhungana, the president of Private and Boarding Schools\u2019 Organisation Nepal (PABSON), says the schools should easily accept the condition of the students whether they are strong or weak in studies. According to their condition, they should be encouraged in their studies, he maintains.\n\nIn his view, the schools and guardians should work together to improve the studies of such students. \u201cThey should maintain frequent communication with each other to stay updated on the student\u2019s academic progress,\u201d says Dhungana, \u201cThey should timely share the student\u2019s weaknesses and progress with each other. These things were lacking in the recent incident at DAV School.\u201d","title":"Nepali schools bully slow learners.
