Chairman and Prime Minister KP Oli, who was absent from the Secretariat meeting on Wednesday, was present at today\u2019s meeting.\n\nAlthough today\u2019s meeting was expected to find a \u2018way out\u2019 for resolving the dispute, a Secretariat member stated that the verbal assault continued today as well.\n\nAt a meeting held at the PM\u2019s residence in Baluwatar, Chairman Oli reiterated his old point.\n\nStating that there was no need to hold a meeting, Oli also indicated that he would not attend the Standing Committee (SC) meeting scheduled at the party\u2019s central office in Dhumbarahi on Sunday.\n\nChairman Oli said that a meeting of the Standing Committee was convened for Sunday without setting an agenda.\n\nHe also accused the majority of members including Executive Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal alias Prachanda of using force.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not use too much force. I have said it before. Prachanda\u2019s letter of insult is not suitable for discussion. It should be taken back; I can\u2019t take it to the Standing Committee. The meeting of the Standing Committee will not be held tomorrow. Let\u2019s discuss this here. Let\u2019s draw a conclusion. Only then, the meeting can be held,\u201d the member said, quoting Oli at a Secretariat meeting on Saturday.\n\nAccording to a leader who participated in the meeting, the meeting that lasted for three and a half hours was focused on summoning the Standing Committee meeting or not.\n\nThe proposal of resolving the issue by forming a task force was also raised in the meeting. Secretariat member Ram Bahadur Thapa alias Badal, who is also the Home Minister, had proposed to form a task force to resolve the dispute.\n\nBadal had proposed to resolve the dispute by forming a task force comprising Secretariat members, saying that if the party\u2019s dispute reached the standing committee, it would send a message that the Secretariat had failed.\n\nGeneral Secretary Bishnu Poudel also supported Badal\u2019s proposal. In the meeting, General Secretary Poudel and Ishwor Pokharel also said that tomorrow\u2019s meeting should not be held.\n\nHowever, the member said that Poudel and Pokharel were also ready for the meeting after it was agreed to continue the informal dialogue.\n\nHowever, Badal\u2019s proposal was rejected by Vice-chairman Bamdev Gautam.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t\u2019 be in the task force. Instead, I also have written documents, I will present them at the meeting,\u201d said a Secretariat member quoting Gautam.\n\nThe leader said that Prime Minister Oli was also positive about forming a task force.\n\nChairman Prachanda did not speak much at the meeting. He proposed to convene the Standing Committee meeting at party headquarters on Sunday, to which the majority of Secretariat members agreed.\n\nDespite Oli\u2019s stand that the Standing Committee meeting should not be held, the majority of members of the secretariat had concluded that the meeting should be held at the party\u2019s central office in Dhumbarahi on Sunday afternoon. Accordingly, Spokesperson Narayankaji Shrestha briefed the media after the meeting.","title":"NCP Secretariat meeting ends amidst \u2018verbal attacks\u2019, Oli unlikely to attend SC meeting - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/05/146866/","video":[]}
