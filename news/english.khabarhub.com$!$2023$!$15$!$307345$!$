The researchers say the study demonstrates higher levels of physical activity should be promoted as a major strategy for type 2 diabetes prevention, which affects millions of Australians.\n\nThe study involved 59,325 adults from the UK Biobank, who wore accelerometers (activity trackers worn on their wrist) at the start of the study and were then followed for up to seven years to track health outcomes.\n\nThe UK Biobank is a large-scale biomedical database and research resource containing anonymised genetic, lifestyle and health information from half a million UK participants.\n\nThis included genetic markers associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\nPeople with a high genetic risk score had 2.4 times the risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with those with a low genetic risk score.\n\nThe study showed more than an hour of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity per day was associated with a 74 percent lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with participants who did less than 5 minutes of physical activity.\n\nThis was even when other factors, including genetic risk, were accounted for. Another compelling finding was that participants with a high genetic risk, but who were in the most physically active category, actually had a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with those with a low genetic risk but in the least active category.\n\nSenior author Associate Professor Melody Ding from the Charles Perkins Centre and the Faculty of Medicine and Health says although the role of genetics and physical activity in the onset of type 2 diabetes is well established, until now most data was self-reported and there was little evidence whether the genetic risk could be counteracted by physical activity.\n\n\u201cWe are unable to control our genetic risk and family history, but this finding provides promising and positive news that through an active lifestyle, one can \u2018fight off\u2019 much of the excessive risk for type 2 diabetes.\u201d\n\n(ANI)","title":"Exercise can help reduce risk of type 2 diabetes: Study","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/15/307345/","video":[]}
