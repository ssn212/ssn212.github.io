Protests have also erupted globally.\n\nAmid the chaos, police said Khan's hearing on Wednesday would be moved to the location where he is under custody.\n\nPolice have carried out raids and arrested supporters of Khan's party in the hours since his arrest.\n\nThe former international cricket star is facing dozens of charges relating to corruption and sedition, which he says are politically motivated.\n\nPictures early on Wednesday local time showed lines of officers forming in front of a police building in the capital Islamabad. A police guest house has been declared a \"courtroom\" for the hearing, a police official told BBC Urdu.\n\nOther photos show scores of vehicles badly burned in Pakistan's largest city Karachi, after overnight protests.\n\nMobile internet services remain inaccessible across the country. Pakistan's telecommunication authorities said they had suspended services on instructions from the interior ministry.\n\nSchools also remain closed, some highways have been blocked and there is little traffic plying roads in major cities.\n\nKhan's supporters have also taken to the streets in the UK, US and Canada, among other countries, following his detention.\n\nProtests are expected to continue on Wednesday, with some demonstrators planning to march to Islamabad.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Newshour, Khan's spokesman, Raoof Hasan, said he expected \"the worst\" and that the arrest could plunge the country \"into chaos and anarchy\".\n\nKhan was arrested on Tuesday while in court in Islamabad to face charges in various graft cases.\n\nDramatic footage showed dozens of security officers forcibly removing the 70-year-old Khan from the court, then bundling him into a police vehicle.\n\nTuesday's arrest was based on a new warrant for a separate graft case, connected to a case involving the transfer of land for Al-Qadir University, near Islamabad. It is the latest in an escalating political battle between Khan and Pakistan's powerful army.\n\nMany analysts believe Khan's election win in 2018 happened with the help of the military. But now in opposition, he has become one of the military's most vocal critics.\n\nKhan was ousted as prime minister in April last year and has been campaigning for early elections since then. The polls are due to be held later this year.\n\nHours before the arrest, party officials released a pre-recorded video by Khan, in which he urged supporters to come out in support of \"true freedom\".\n\n\"My Pakistanis, by the time these words reach you I would have been detained under an illegitimate case,\" he says in the video.\n\n\"One thing that should become clear for all of you from this is that fundamental rights in Pakistan, the rights given to us by our constitution and democracy, have been buried.\"\n\n(BBC)","title":"Imran Khan: Tense mood grips Pakistan ahead of Former PM's Hearing","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/27694/ahead-of-former-pm's-hearing-","video":[]}
