The social media giant has denied the allegations.\n\nThe outcome of the hearing was unclear.\n\nIndia is Facebook\u2019s largest market with nearly 328 million users. Facebook also owns WhatsApp, which has more than 400 million users in India.\n\nAs usage has spread across India, Facebook and WhatsApp have become fierce battlegrounds for India\u2019s political parties. Leaders of Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist party have come under scrutiny for running online campaigns laced with false claims and attacks on the minority Muslim population.\n\nModi\u2019s party and its leaders have repeatedly denied the allegations and instead accuse Facebook of censoring pro-India content.\n\nOn Tuesday, technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad wrote to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and said the platform was censoring content posted by right-wing users.\n\nIn August, the main opposition Congress party wrote two letters to Zuckerberg asking him to specify steps being taken by his company to investigate allegations against its operations in India after a Wall Street Journal report said Facebook India\u2019s head of public policy, Anhki Das, \u201copposed applying hate-speech rules\u201d on members of Modi\u2019s party even after the issue was flagged internally.\n\nIn the second letter, the party said it was considering \u201clegislative and judicial action\u201d to make sure \u201ca foreign company cannot continue to cause social disharmony.\u201d\n\nTwo Facebook spokeswomen did not immediately comment. On Aug. 21, the company denied any bias toward Modi\u2019s party and said it was \u201copen, transparent and non-partisan.\u201d\n\nThe company said in a recent email to AP that it enforces content moderation policies globally \u201cwithout regard to anyone\u2019s political position or party affiliation.\u201d\n\nFacebook and WhatsApp have often been used to spread hate speech to incite deadly attacks on minority groups amid rising communal tensions across India.\n\nA 2019 analysis by Equality Labs, a South Asia research organization, showed that groups sharing anti-Muslim content on Facebook included supporters of Modi\u2019s party or were linked to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organization and the ideological parent of the BJP. It found that 93% of the hate speech reported to Facebook was not removed.\n\nThenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of Equality Labs, said Facebook lacks the capacity to remove widespread hate speech on its own and has been disingenuous and slow to act.\n\n\u201cThey have no interest in removing violent users because it is against their business interests,\u201d Soundararajan said.\n\nShe said Facebook India must ensure diversity in its content moderation team and consumer oversight of hate content.\n\nThe controversy comes as Facebook and Jio, India\u2019s cheapest and most popular phone service provider, await a green light from India\u2019s Supreme Court to roll out WhatsApp Pay, an e-commerce and digital payments platform poised to help the social media behemoth further penetrate India\u2019s trillion-dollar digital market.\n\nFacebook invested $5.7 billion in cash in Reliance Jio, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, whose chairman, Mukesh Ambani, is India\u2019s richest man.","title":"Facebook India grilled over anti-Muslim hate speech, alleged pro-Modi bias","url":"http://en.setopati.com/political/153815","video":[]}
