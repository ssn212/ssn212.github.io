We are delighted to be flying to Nepal again and this thrice-weekly service to Kathmandu will help reunite many stranded passengers who have been unable to return home due to global travel restrictions. We welcome the reopening of Nepal to commercial flights and I want to thank the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation for their support in helping us to operate several charter flights throughout this pandemic to help get people home.\u201d\n\nQatar Airways continues to lead the industry in providing global connectivity by resuming flights to just over half the destinations it operated pre-COVID-19.\n\nSince the onset of the pandemic, Qatar Airways network has never fallen below 30 destinations with continuous services to five continents.\n\nBy mid-September, the national carrier of the State of Qatar will operate over 650 weekly flights to more than 85 destinations, providing more flexible travel options to more global destinations than any other airline.\n\nTo ensure travelers can plan their travel with peace of mind, the airline has extended its booking policies to offer even more choice to its passengers.\n\nThe airline will allow unlimited date changes, and passengers can change their destination as often as they need if it is within 5,000 miles of the original destination.\n\nThe airline will not charge any fare differences for travel completed before 31 December 2020, after which fare rules will apply.\n\nAll tickets booked for travel up to 31 December, 2020 will be valid for two years from the date of issuance. For full terms and conditions visit qatarairways.com/RelyOnUs.\n\nAccording to the latest IATA data, Qatar Airways has become the largest international carrier between April to June by fulfilling its mission of taking people home.\n\nThe carrier has stringently implemented the most advanced safety and hygiene measures on board its aircraft and in Hamad International Airport.\n\nQatar Airways\u2019 on-board safety measures for passengers and cabin crew include the provision of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for cabin crew and a complimentary protective kit and disposable face shields for passengers.\n\nBusiness Class passengers on aircraft equipped with Qsuite can enjoy the enhanced privacy this award-winning business seat provides, including sliding privacy partitions and the option to use a \u2018Do Not Disturb (DND)\u2019 indicator.\n\nQsuite is available on flights to more than 30 destinations including Frankfurt, Kuala Lumpur, London and New York. For full details of all the measures that have been implemented on board and in HIA, please visit qatarairways.com/safety.\n\nQatar Airways operations are not dependent on any specific aircraft type. The airline\u2019s variety of modern fuel-efficient aircraft has meant it can continue flying by offering the right capacity in each market.\n\nDue to COVID-19\u2019s impact on travel demand, the airline has taken the decision to ground its fleet of Airbus A380s as it is not commercially or environmentally justifiable to operate such a large aircraft in the current market.\n\nThe airline\u2019s fleet of 49 Airbus A350 and 30 Boeing 787 are the ideal choice for the most strategically important long-haul routes to Africa, the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific regions.\n\nQatar Airways\u2019 home and hub, Hamad International Airport (HIA), has implemented stringent cleaning procedures and applied social distancing measures throughout its terminals. Passenger touchpoints are sanitized every 10-15 minutes and boarding gates and bus gate counters are cleaned after each flight.\n\nIn addition, hand sanitizers are provided at immigration and security screening points. HIA was recently ranked \u201cThird Best Airport in the World\u201d, among 550 airports worldwide, by the SKYTRAX World Airport Awards 2020.\n\nHIA was also voted the \u2018Best Airport in the Middle East\u2019 for the sixth year in a row and \u2018Best Staff Service in the Middle East\u2019 for the fifth year in a row.","title":"Qatar Airways resumes three weekly flights from Kathmandu - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/13/127219/","video":[]}
