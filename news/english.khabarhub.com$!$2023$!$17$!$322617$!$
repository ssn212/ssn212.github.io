Even after its provision, we persisted in the legal battle,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAfter extensive struggle and determination, we have achieved a breakthrough. Fifty million non-resident Nepalis have been enabled to acquire this citizenship \u2013 a monumental accomplishment,\u201d he asserted in his speech.\n\nThe Prime Minister disclosed that under his leadership, the government has proposed the citizenship bill to the President, thereby paving the way for non-residents to obtain Nepalese citizenship.\n\n\u201cI have recently entrusted the non-resident Nepalese citizenship to the association\u2019s president, Kul Acharya, and Badri KC,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cOn this momentous occasion, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all, including Kulji. I am confident that millions of non-resident Nepalis around the globe comprehend the magnitude of the struggle and initiative behind this citizenship. This understanding will also be disseminated to all our friends and the entire Nepali community,\u201d stated Prime Minister Dahal.\n\nHe highlighted the government\u2019s commitment to addressing various issues concerning non-resident Nepalis through policy, budget allocations, and programs.\n\nNotably, the Prime Minister underscored the reduction of the minimum foreign investment limit from 50 million to 20 million rupees, facilitating more significant opportunities for non-resident Nepalis.\n\nFurthermore, legal provisions have been established to enable non-resident Nepalis to participate in the secondary market of securities, while their inclusion in the contribution-based social security through the social security fund has been effectively implemented.\n\n\u201cThis appears to be a historic milestone. Over three lakh workers have already embraced this movement, and we anticipate a surge in this number in the near future. I urge the Non-Resident Nepali Association to provide institutional support,\u201d he urged.\n\nPrime Minister Dahal also expressed his confidence that the National Convention of the Non-Resident Nepalese Association would foster a unified and robust leadership.","title":"I made great strides to ensure non-resident citizenship: PM Dahal","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/17/322617/","video":[]}
