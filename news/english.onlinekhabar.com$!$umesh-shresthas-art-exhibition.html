He says, \u201cThis is my attempt to be true to myself and art is the only thing that helps me connect to myself, my true identity.\u201d\n\nPaintings by Umesh Shrestha Mundane Friction to Self Flow at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Sangita Shrestha\n\nViewers can witness his beautifully executed oil and acrylic paintings focusing on the tundals, temple struts, toranas and deities of Nepal. However, huge temple bells are his signature motif used frequently in his paintings, since 2004. The exhibition kicked off on September 8 at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal where one can also view paintings dealing with figures, landscapes, portraits and more.\n\nAt the exhibition\n\nUmesh Shrestha believes that artists should rise up from their roots and create their truth, being honest with their inner expressions. And this is visible in the exhibition where his culture, tradition and observation come alive in the form of paintings and drawings. He says, \u201cMy works are the response to my surroundings including socio-political scenes.\u201d\n\nArtist Umesh Shrestha at the exhibition Mundane Friction to Self Flow at Siddhartha Art Gallery. Photo: Sangita Shrestha\n\nUmesh Shrestha has used acrylic and oil colour mediums on canvas and created paintings that are a mix of realistic and abstract forms. There are human figures as well as different geometric forms which are placed in harmony projecting his concept and a distinct voice.\n\nIn one of his paintings, \u2018Dream, reality & soliloquy\u2019 he explores the condition of Nepal and those who joined the Maoist force for the People\u2019s Movement in 1996 with the hope of a better nation and future. This movement is parallelly compared with the People\u2019s Movement of France, in which he takes the reference of Picasso\u2019s Guernica and asks a serious question about the authenticity of the People\u2019s Movement in Nepal.\n\n\u2018Dream, reality & soliloquy\u2019 by Umesh Shrestha Mundane Friction to Self flow at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Sangita Shrestha\n\nIn the painting, the part where Guernica is painted, its sky is clear showing the vast horizon and the path is also clear. However, the part of the sky where he has painted the Maoist guerrilla woman holding a rifle is obstructed by a horizontal check line. Nevertheless, a wooden ladder has been placed on top of it up to the moon. Then at the centre of the canvas inside a frame, he painted a temple bell. Moreover, on the bottom of the frame he has painted the flag of Nepal on a crumbled paper and the base of the figures has been distorted showing uncertainty about the people\u2019s path as well as the nation\u2019s dilemma.\n\nShrestha through this painting questions the legitimacy of the People\u2019s Movement and the death of around 12,000 people. Along with it, he questions the sacrifice of lives who joined Maoist rebels for a better future.\n\n\u201cWhat has war given us? Nothing,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, with the use of the temple bell in his paintings he depicts his trust towards divinity and hopes for a better future despite having an uncertain present.\n\nLikewise, in another painting \u2018Between Tech and Power Game\u2019 he showcases the current conflict in the world which is similar to the war happening due to technology, along with showing the superiority of the nation by having and using the latest technology. In the painting, again a temple bell becomes the centre of the canvas and it is in motion. Under the bell, he has pasted the parts of the CPU\u2014motherboard signifying the use of technology.\n\nPainting by Umesh Shrestha Mundane Friction to Self flow at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal.

Or is it all the above and is this the mundane friction that the artist is visually referring to?\u201d\n\nPainting by Umesh Shrestha Mundane Friction to Self Flow at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Sangita Shrestha\n\nMoreover, Shrestha says that the things he experienced, observed and became passionate about inspired him to create motifs like the temple bell.\n\n\u201cWhen I came to Kathmandu I was just a teenager and going against my parents I pursued a Fine Arts education. This led to my isolation from my family,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd when you have no one who supports you, you survive and keep on moving believing in one great energy and this is where the temple bell existed in my paintings.\u201d\n\nEventually, in the course of following his passion, he completed his MFA and also became an academician at the Nepal Academy of Fine Arts from 2014 to 2018. Likewise, he met his life partner in the course of wandering and teaching art in schools.\n\n\u201cWhoever I have become today, it is all because of my passion for art,\u201d he says. \u201cOne should be determined in own passion and no matter what challenges life offers you, you have to take and keep moving on trusting yourself. This is how life led me till here.\u201d\n\nToday in his late 40\u2019s he is not only an artist but also a father to his architect/artist son. Shrestha who realises the potential of art and how impactful it is, says, \u201cNow I can focus more on my art and I am looking forward to creating a series of paintings exploring socio-political context.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition continues till September 29.","title":"Umesh Shrestha odyssey of emotions, faith, and identity","url":"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/umesh-shresthas-art-exhibition.html","video":[]}
