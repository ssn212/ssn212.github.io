The racketeers have been executing organized crime.\n\nFake Nepali currency seized from Kathmandu in last three years\n\nJuly 31, 2020: A Nepali national arrested from Shantinagar, Kathmandu with 10 fake notes of Rs 1,000\n\nJuly 24, 2020: A Nepali national arrested from Budhanilkantha, Kathmandu with 19 fake notes of Rs 1,000\n\nJanuary 9, 2020: Four arrested from a fake currency printing center in Kathmandu, fake currency worth 413 thousand seized\n\nOctober 21, 2019: Three arrested from Gokarneshwor-6, Nayabasti; 34 fake notes of Rs 1,000 and the device used to print the notes seized from them\n\nJanuary 30, 2019: One arrested from Gongabu, Kathmandu with fake Nepali currency worth Rs 150 thousand\n\nOctober 21, 2018: Five arrested from different places in the capital with fake Nepali currency worth Rs 370 thousand\n\nOctober 12, 2018: One arrested from Ratna Park, Kathmandu with fake currency worth Rs 10000\n\nOctober 9, 2018: One arrested from Ratna Park, Kathmandu with fake currency worth Rs 5,000\n\nMay 16, 2018: Six arrested with fake currency worth Rs 26.06 million\n\n(Source: Metropolitan Police Circle, Kathmandu)\n\nBesides, there have been several cases of fake Nepali currency in Kathmandu. According to SSP Gyawali, lately, Kathmandu has witnessed several instances of fake currency quite frequently.\n\n\u201cPreviously, there used to be the cases of fake Indian currency, but nowadays, instances of Nepali fake currency are quite frequent,\u201d he conceded.\n\nThe watermark is not a print on the paper, it\u2019s there while making the paper itself, so it is distinct and can be seen from both sides, but the fake currencies don\u2019t have such a feature.\n\nAccording to him, the criminals have been using color photocopy machine to print Nepali notes. Currently, Nepal Police have seized the printing devices from many places in Kathmandu.\n\nPolice record shows that the instances of fake currency are more common especially during the festival time at the cramped places with high transaction frequency.\n\n\u201cRestaurants, shops and places with more transaction ratios are regarded as a safe haven for the criminals,\u201d police sources claim.\n\nInvolvement of organized criminal groups in fake currency transactions\n\nExperts point out that organized groups are particularly involved in making and circulating fake currencies in Nepal.\n\n\u201cThe ambitious youths, particularly, work in an organized way to execute the transaction of fake currency,\u201d former DIG Devendra Subedi, who has spent considerable time in the Crime Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police said.\n\n\u201cThere are some Indians as well,\u201d he said adding that the main market of fake Nepali currency is Nepal itself.\n\nThe counterfeiters chose crowded areas and the places which make big transactions and insert the fake notes in the bundles so as to let the counterfeit money circulate without hindrance.\n\nFormer DIG Hemanta Malla who has spent considerable time in top posts of the Central Investigation Bureau and Special Bureau claims that fake currency transactions are getting quite frequent in Nepal now.\n\n\u201cA few years ago, if anyone talked about counterfeit money, obviously it used to be Indian currency. However, the case is getting more complicated these days.\u201d Malla added.\n\n\u201cMost of such cases in Nepal are related to Nepali fake currency. What\u2019s more! Now the printers and factories are also found in Nepal,\u201d he shed light on the current trends.\n\nMalla expects cooperation from the public in curbing the circulation of fake currency.\n\nHow to identify counterfeit currency from the genuine one\n\nThe officials at Nepal Rastra Bank suggest people look at watermark to distinguish the fake note from the genuine one.\n\n\u201cWhen we turn the note towards the light and look on it we can see the image of rhododendron on it,\u201d NRB officials say, \u201cthe watermark is distinct whale looking at the note from both sides.\u201d\n\nThe watermark is not a print on the paper, it\u2019s there while making the paper itself, so it is distinct and can be seen from both sides, but the fake currencies don\u2019t have such a feature.\n\nAnother method of distinguishing the fake currency is looking for the security thread. In it, one can see NRB and the mirror image of NRB in order.\n\nLike the rhododendron watermark, the security thread is also inserted while making the paper itself.\n\nThe printed words or marks in the notes can be seen even at the place where the security thread is inserted.\n\nWhat do legal provisions say?\n\nClause 256 of the National Criminal Code Act 2017 has provisions related to counterfeit money. This clause provisions that a person involved in such crime can be fined from Rs 50 thousand to Rs 100 thousand along with 5-10 years imprisonment.\n\nPolice have been using the NCC Act while taking action against the counterfeiters, but citing the increasing number of cases, former AIG Subedi hails it important to aware the public about such chances.","title":"Counterfeit currency racketeers strengthening network - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/16/142032/","video":[]}
