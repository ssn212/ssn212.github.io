And if that T-shirt is going to the landfill, replaced by another T-shirt, that is going to multiply what is already an unsustainable pattern.\u201d\n\nGlobal issue\n\nFast fashion is not only a problem in the United States but in poorer countries where donated clothes arrive and are then resold by vendors.\n\n\u201cKenya and Ghana import quite a lot of fast fashion clothing that is causing a huge amount of pollution,\u201d explained Erica Cirino, communications manager for the Plastic Pollution Coalition in Washington. \u201cThe landfills are so overwhelmed by textile waste that they begin flowing into the surrounding waterways.\n\nFrom stylish to disastrous\n\nWhen retailers first introduced fast fashion apparel in the 1990s, the inexpensive and trendy clothing appealed to consumers. Today, its omnipresence in stores and on the internet in the U.S. and other wealthy countries, has made the fast fashion industry a disaster for the environment.\n\nThe clothes are often made from synthetic plastic fabrics, such as polyester, nylon and acrylic, which are produced from petroleum-based products \u2014 fossil fuels that are causing global warming.\n\n\u201cThe heavy reliance by brands on polyester, nylon, acrylic is only increasing,\u201d said Cirino, \u201cso a great majority of clothing today is made out of plastic that is much less expensive than natural materials.\u201d\n\nResearchers have found microfibers from clothing in a wide range of land and aquatic ecosystems \u2014 from mountains to ocean floors.\n\n\u201cWe call this a global microplastic cycle, where tiny microfibers and other microplastics can move thousands of miles from urban areas, where there are tons of people wearing synthetic clothing, to the most remote corners of the planet, including the top of Mount Everest,\u201d said Britta Baechler, associate director of oceans plastics research with the Ocean Conservancy in Portland, Oregon.\n\nEach year, approximately 6.5 million metric tons of microfibers are released into the environment worldwide, according to the Journal of Hazardous Materials. That\u2019s equivalent to more than 32 billion T-shirts.\n\n\u201cAs you\u2019re walking, the material is rubbing together and that that causes fibers to break loose that shed directly into the air and make their way into the waterways,\u201d Baechler told VOA.\n\nMicrofibers in washing machines\n\nHowever, experts say, the biggest source of environmental microfiber is washing machines in the U.S. that do not have filters to catch the tiny fibers.\n\nWastewater treatment plants filter out the majority of microfibers, but because they are so small, some still get into the waterways. They harm small aquatic organisms that ingest them by creating blockages that hinder their absorption of nutrients from food.\n\nIt is not yet clear what the effect of microfibers is on humans.\n\n\u201cWhen we wear this clothing, we\u2019re inhaling and potentially absorbing these plastic particles and their toxic chemical additives through our skin, so we\u2019re exposed at all times,\u201d said Cirino.\n\nUnlike some materials, there is currently no widespread system for recycling textiles.\n\nThere are facilities to recycle paper, glass and some plastics, there isn\u2019t an easy way to recycle textiles by shredding them and making them into new textiles, explained Swarupa Ganguli, lead environmental protection specialist in the office of land and emergency management for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nFashionable options\n\nInstead of buying fast fashions, environmental groups say people should think about purchasing clothes at second-hand shops or on the internet and rent outfits for special occasions.\n\nThe Patagonia outdoor clothing and gear company in Ventura, California, has a program called Worn Wear to try to keep its clothes out of landfills. The company rebuys some of its used clothing, which is cleaned and resold.\n\n\u201cWorn Wear is based on the premise that reducing the environmental impact of our products must be a shared responsibility between Patagonia and our customers,\u201d said Corey Simpson, the communications manager for product and sport community. \u201cWe want to help you with responsible product care while you\u2019re using your gear, and we want to buy it back from you when you no longer need it, whether it can be passed on to someone new or recycled into something new.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency favors what is being called a circular economy approach. This includes redesigning clothes and encouraging the reuse and recycling of clothing.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to shift the consumer mindset from using clothing quickly and then throwing it away, and instead to reuse, reduce and recirculate it back into the economy,\u201d Ganguli told VOA.\n\nWhile \u201cthe circular economy for textiles has huge potential,\u201d said Metzger with the World Resources Institute, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can say it is working until the circular economy for textiles is slowing and reversing the consumption.\u201d\n\n(VOA)","title":"Mass-produced clothing causes serious air, water pollution worldwide","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/03/313026/","video":[]}
