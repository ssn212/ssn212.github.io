They will have to compulsorily wear the face mask.\n\nAlthough the temple opens from Wednesday, the special puja, singing of hymns and ritual activities, however, would not start immediately.\n\n\u201cWe were compelled to restrict ourselves during the crisis of the pandemic. We will gradually start operating the special puja, singing of hymns and other rituals that have been suspended by adopting health safety procedures after the temple\u2019s opening on Wednesday,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral religious organizations had been carrying out a symbolic protest at the Pashupati area under the leadership of the World Hindu Federation, saying the devotees have not been able to visit the temple for worship as it remained closed for nine months.\n\nThe organizations demanding opening the temple too are preparing to organize special worship in the Pashupati precincts on Tuesday.\n\nPADT stated that special security alertness is to be adopted in the Pashupati area as the temple is opening after long amidst the existing risk of coronavirus infection. A meeting attended by all the security bodies was organized in this connection, said PADT treasurer Dr Milan Kumar Thapa.\n\nEven the religious tourists have not arrived in the Pashupati area since the last week of March. The shops selling flowers and items for worship also remained closed for nine months. The PADT has suffered losses of around Rs 700 million due to this, PADT executive director Dr Ghanashyam Khatiwada said.\n\nHowever, the offering of regular prayer and worship, aarati, food offerings and the crematorium services were continued during the nine months. PADT former member-secretary Dr Gobinda Tandon, who has done his Ph.D. research on the Pashupati area, said it is not found in the history and genealogical annals regarding the Pashupatinath temple remaining shut for so long.\n\nRSS","title":"Pashupatinath Temple to open to devotees from tomorrow - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/15/148888/","video":[]}
