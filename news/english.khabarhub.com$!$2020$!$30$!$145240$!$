Upon returning home from acute care, large proportions of survivors experience functional dependencies, pain, dyspnea, and exhaustion.\n\nIn the study rich data from more than 1,400, COVID-19 patients admitted to home health care after hospital discharge describes home visit care and recovery extent.\n\nThe study indicates that increasing referrals to home health care has the potential to provide support and achieve improved recovery for these patients.\n\n\u201cOur findings suggest that acute care providers might carefully consider which COVID-19 survivors would benefit from home health care after hospitalization,\u201d writes Kathryn H.
