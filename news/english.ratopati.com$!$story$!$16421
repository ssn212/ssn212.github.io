It is an indigenous calendar of Nepal and has reached the year 1141. Shankhadhar Sakhwa, who got a national recognition posthumously from the Government of Nepal for his contribution during Lichchhavi dynasty, founded Nepal Sambat after freeing citizens of the country from their debts. The New Year is being celebrated in commemoration of this day.\n\nOn the occasion, Nepal Sambat 1141 Nhuda National Celebration Committee organised a greeting meeting at the City Hall at Bhrikutimandap. The meeting was attended by a limited number of people by following health guidelines and maintaining social distancing in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe usual trend of taking out a cultural rally throughout various parts of Kathmandu and organizing a variety of programmes has been altered this year due to the infection. Addressing the meeting, Minister for Urban Development Krishna Gopal Shrestha suggested that the New Year should be observed throughout the year instead of celebrating it once a year with fanfare.\n\nSaying that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli himself was in favour of making a long-term plan to spread and make Nepal Sambat last long, the minister said, \u201cYou bring a long-term proposal relating to Nepal Sambat. The Kathmandu Metropolitan City has helped with the campaign to construct Manka: Chhe, a symbol of the Newar community, and the Ministry of Urban Development will extend a helping hand in this regard if need be,\u201d he said.\n\nKMC Mayor Bidya Sundar Shakya informed that the statue of Shankhadhar Sakhwa at Ranipokhari would be unveiled on November 21. On the occasion, the Committee\u2019s treasurer Amrit Tamrakar presented expenditure and income details of the Committee throughout the year.","title":"Newar community observes Nepal Sambat New Year","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/16421","video":[]}
