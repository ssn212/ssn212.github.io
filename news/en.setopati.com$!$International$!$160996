Some said they also saw what appeared to be a police officer and a mall security guard unconscious on the ground.\n\nThe shooting was the latest episode of gun violence to strike the country. It sent hundreds of shoppers fleeing in panic.\n\nDashcam video that circulated online showed a gunman step out of a vehicle outside the mall and immediately start shooting at people on the sidewalk. More than three dozen shots could be heard as the vehicle recording the video drove off.\n\nMaxwell Gum, a 16-year-old shift leader at Wetzel\u2019s Pretzels, was on his lunch break when a family with limited English ran into the back of his store, urgently telling him, \u201cGun! Shoot!\u201d as the sound of gunfire could be heard in the background.\n\nHe brought the family into the long delivery corridor that runs behind the mall\u2019s stores, hoping it would be a safe place to hide. They found chaos.\n\n\u201cThere were probably like 300 people pouring in from all the different doors,\u201d Gum said. \u201cPeople are freaking out, we\u2019re hearing screaming.\u201d\n\nAllen Fire Chief Jonathan Boyd said seven people including the shooter died at the scene. Nine victims were taken to area hospitals, but two of them died.\n\nThree of the victims were in critical condition Saturday evening, Boyd said, and four were in stable condition.\n\nAn Allen Police officer was in the area on an unrelated call when he heard shots at 3:36 p.m., the police department wrote on Facebook.\n\n\u201cThe officer engaged the suspect and neutralized the threat. He then called for emergency personnel,\u201d the agency wrote in the Facebook post.\n\nMass killings are happening with staggering frequency in the United States this year: an average of about one a week, according to an analysis of The AP/USA Today data.\n\nThe White House said President Biden had been briefed on the shooting and that the administration had offered support to local officials. Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has signed laws easing firearms restrictions following past mass shootings, called it an \u201cunspeakable tragedy.\u201d\n\nFontayne Payton, 35, was at H&M when he heard the sound of gunshots through the headphones he was wearing.\n\n\u201cIt was so loud, it sounded like it was right outside,\u201d Payton said.\n\nPeople in the store scattered before employees ushered the group into the fitting rooms and then a lockable back room, he said. When they were given the all-clear to leave, Payton saw the store had broken windows and a trail of blood to the door. Discarded sandals and bloodied clothes were laying nearby.\n\nOnce outside, Payton saw bodies.\n\n\u201cI pray it wasn\u2019t kids, but it looked like kids,\u201d he said. The bodies were covered in white towels, slumped over bags on the ground, he said.\n\n\u201cIt broke me when I walked out to see that,\u201d he said.\n\nFurther away, he saw the body of a heavyset man wearing all black. He assumed it was the shooter, Payton said, because unlike the other bodies it had not been covered up.\n\nTarakram Nunna, 25, and Ramakrishna Mullapudi, 26, said they saw what appeared to be three people lying motionless on the ground, including one who appeared to be a police officer and another who appeared to be a mall security guard.\n\nAnother shopper, Sharkie Mouli, 24, said he hid in a Banana Republic store during the shooting. As he left, he saw what appeared to be an unconscious police officer lying next to another unconscious person outside the outlet store.\n\n\u201cI have seen his gun lying right next to him and a guy who is like passing out right next to him,\u201d Mouli said.\n\nStan and Mary Ann Greene were browsing in the Columbia sportswear store when the shooting started.\n\n\u201cWe had just gotten in, just a couple minutes earlier, and we just heard a lot of loud popping,\u201d Mary Ann Greene told The Associated Press.\n\nEmployees immediately rolled down the security gate and brought everyone to the rear of the store until police arrived and escorted them out, the Greenes said.\n\nEber Romero was at the Under Armour store when a cashier mentioned that there was a shooting.\n\nAs he left the store, Romero said, the mall appeared empty, and all the shops had their security gates down. That is when he started seeing broken glass and people who had been shot on the floor.\n\nVideo shared on social media showed people running through a parking lot while gunfire could be heard.\n\nMore than 30 police cruisers with lights flashing were blocking an entrance to the mall, with multiple ambulances on the scene.\n\nA live aerial broadcast from the news station showed armored trucks and other law enforcement vehicles stationed outside the sprawling outdoor mall.\n\nAmbulances from several neighboring cities responded to the scene.\n\nThe Dallas office of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also responded.\n\nAllen, a suburb about 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of downtown Dallas, has roughly 105,000 residents.","title":"8 killed in Texas mall shooting, gunman also dead","url":"http://en.setopati.com/International/160996","video":[]}
