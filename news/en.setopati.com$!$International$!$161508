The pill is taken once a day for 14 days.\n\n\u201cHaving access to an oral medication will be a beneficial option for many of these women coping with extreme, and sometimes life-threatening, feelings,\u201d said Dr. Tiffany Farchione, FDA\u2019s director of psychiatric drugs, in a statement.\n\nPostpartum depression affects an estimated 400,000 people a year, and while it often ends on its own within a couple weeks, it can continue for months or even years. Standard treatment includes counseling or antidepressants, which can take weeks to work and don\u2019t help everyone.\n\nThe new pill is from Sage Therapeutics, which has a similar infused drug that\u2019s given intravenously over three days in a medical facility. The FDA approved that drug in 2019, though it isn\u2019t widely used because of its $34,000 price tag and the logistics of administering it.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s pill approval is based on two company studies that showed women who took Zurzuvae had fewer signs of depression over a four- to six-week period when compared with those who received a dummy pill. The benefits, measured using a psychiatric test, appeared within three days for many patients.\n\nSahar McMahon, 39, had never experienced depression until after the birth of her second daughter in late 2021. She agreed to enroll in a study of the drug, known chemically as zuranolone, after realizing she no longer wanted to spend time with her children.\n\n\u201cI planned my pregnancies, I knew I wanted those kids but I didn\u2019t want to interact with them,\u201d said McMahon, who lives in New York City. She says her mood and outlook started improving within days of taking the first pills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a quick transition for me just waking up and starting to feel like myself again,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Kimberly Yonkers of Yale University said the Zurzuvae effect is \u201cstrong\u201d and the drug likely will be prescribed for women who haven\u2019t responded to antidepressants. She wasn\u2019t involved in testing the drug.\n\nStill, she said, the FDA should have required Sage to submit more follow-up data on how women fared after additional months.\n\n\u201cThe problem is we don\u2019t know what happens after 45 days,\u201d said Yonkers, a psychiatrist who specializes in postpartum depression. \u201cIt could be that people are well or it could be that they relapse.\u201d\n\nSage did not immediately announce how it would price the pill, and Yonkers said that\u2019ll be a key factor in how widely its prescribed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSide effects with the new drug are milder than the IV version, and include drowsiness and dizziness. The drug was co-developed with fellow Massachusetts pharmaceutical company Biogen.\n\nBoth the pill and IV forms mimic a derivative of progesterone, the naturally occurring female hormone needed to maintain a pregnancy. Levels of the hormone can plunge after childbirth.\n\nSage\u2019s drugs are part of an emerging class of medications dubbed neurosteroids. These stimulate a different brain pathway than older antidepressants that target serotonin, the chemical linked to mood and emotions.","title":"US health officials approve first pill to treat postpartum depression","url":"http://en.setopati.com/International/161508","video":[]}
