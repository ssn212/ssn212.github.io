The number has soared to 49 in a month this year, he said. Heath workers here have urged the people to pay special attention to hygiene and sanitation to avoid infectious disease which is spread to humans through the bites of larval mites. The district residents have also been asked not to expose their body in bushy areas as bush is a habitat of the mites.\n\nlike wise, the district has also seen dengue patients. Two women and one man were detected with dengue disease in Dasharath municipality of the district, Joshi shared. He called for the people to remain away from mosquito bites to prevent dengue infection as it is a mosquito-borne tropical disease.","title":"49 scrub typhus patients recorded in a month","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/15074","video":[]}
