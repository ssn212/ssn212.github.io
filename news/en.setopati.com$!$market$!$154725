It also said that the company used its market position to exclude rivals and hurt the rights and interests of consumers.\n\nThe meeting came after Chinese regulators last month halted Ant\u2019s $37 billion stock debut in Shanghai and Hong Kong over regulatory changes, and comes just days after China announced an anti-monopoly investigation of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, which owns a 33% stake in Ant Group.\n\nThe orders from regulators could limit Ant Group\u2019s expansion and throw its lucrative finance businesses into disarray.\n\nAnt Group, which started out as a payments services for Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce platform Taobao, has since expanded to offer insurance and investment products to its hundreds of millions of users in mainland China. Jack Ma, the founder of both Alibaba and Ant Group, is one of China\u2019s richest and most prominent entrepreneurs.\n\nRegulators ordered Ant Group to establish a financial holding company and hold sufficient capital. They also said that Ant Group should return to its payments origins, enhance transparency around transactions and prohibit unfair competition, while improving corporate governance and ensuring that it complies with regulatory requirements for its businesses.\n\nAnt Group said in a statement Sunday that it would comply with regulatory requirements and enhance risk management and control, and that a working group would be set up to make the necessary rectifications.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate financial regulators\u2019 guidance and help,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe rectification is an opportunity for Ant Group to strengthen the foundation for our business to grow with full compliance, and to continue focusing on innovating for social good and serving small businesses.\u201d\n\nThe scrutiny of Ant Group and Alibaba comes as China closely examines the influence of the country\u2019s internet sector.\n\nLast month, China released draft regulations to clamp down on anti-competitive practices in the industry, such as signing exclusive agreements with merchants and the use of subsidies to squeeze out competitors.\n\nAlibaba and a company spun off by Tencent Holding Ltd. were fined this month for failing to apply for official approval before proceeding with some acquisitions.\n\nLast Tuesday, regulators met with executives of Alibaba and five other major Chinese internet companies and warned them not to abuse their dominance to drive out competitors through use of exclusive contracts, predatory pricing and other tactics, according to a statement by the State Administration of Market Regulation.","title":"China orders Ant Group to rectify businesses","url":"http://en.setopati.com/market/154725","video":[]}
