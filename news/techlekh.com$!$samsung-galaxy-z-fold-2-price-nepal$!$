It has a punch hole camera on the external display and internal display as well. Bezels look reduced as Samsung claims that the bezels are now 27% smaller.\n\nOne of the new changes comes in the hinge mechanism that comes with a reinforced cam structure. So, now there is less of a gap between the display and the hinge. And, the cam structure also allows the Fold 2 to open in multiple angles like the Z Flip. The hinge also uses sweeper technology to prevent dust and dirt from entering the phone.\n\nALSO READ: Samsung Mobiles Price in Nepal: Features and Specs\n\nThe external display is now large at 6.2 inches. It\u2019s also using a sturdier new Ultra-Thin Glass Display for the internal display which is designed to provide a better touch response feel than the plastic screen on the Fold.\n\nDisplay\n\nThe main foldable display is a 7.6 inch AMOLED display with a refresh rate of 120Hz compared to the 60Hz of the Galaxy Fold. And, the panel is adaptive just like the Note 20 series so, it will automatically adjust the refresh rate according to the usage.\n\nThe main display has a resolution of 1768 x 2208 pixels and comes with HDR 10+ support.\n\nThe outer display on the Fold 2 is now bigger as it measures 6.2 inches compared to 4.6 on the Fold. It\u2019s still a Super AMOLED display with a screen resolution of 816 x 2260 pixels but it doesn\u2019t provide a 120Hz refresh rate.\n\nYou can instantly switch between the two displays. The app will be instantaneously resumed on the external display if you were using it on the main display and vice versa.\n\nHardware\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 sports the Snapdragon 865+ chipset along with 12GB RAM and 256GB/512GB UFS 3.1 internal storage.\n\nSnapdragon 865+ chipset has an Octa-core (1\u00d73.09 GHz Kryo 585 & 3\u00d72.42 GHz Kryo 585 & 4\u00d71.8 GHz Kryo 585) CPU and Adreno 650 GPU.\n\nSince Snapdragon 865+ is the latest and greatest, we will see similar performance as that of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra with 865+. And, it\u2019s also 5G ready.\n\nCameras\n\nThe rear camera design looks similar to that of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. But, you don\u2019t get a 108MP sensor, a 5X Optical zoom, or a 50X Zoom.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 2 features a 12MP main sensor, a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with 123-degree FOV, and a 12MP telephoto sensor with a 2X optical zoom and 10X digital zoom. So, it\u2019s a downgrade from the Note 20 Ultra.\n\nThen, there\u2019s a 10MP selfie camera on the inside and a 10MP sensor on the external display as well. But, you can easily use the main camera as the front camera as well. That\u2019s the advantage of the Fold.\n\nSamsung has crafted software for the camera as well. It has a dual preview which lets the subjects see who they are looking using the front display. Then there\u2019s Flex Mode in which you can position the phone as a laptop and it will keep your subject in focus using a feature called Auto framing.\n\nAnother feature is the Capture View mode that lets you review up to 5 recent pictures on the bottom half of the screen while maintaining the live preview on the other half.\n\nSoftware\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 runs on One UI 2.5 on top of Android 10. It has now fixed lots of app-related issues that were present in the Fold. Microsoft Office now takes advantage of the larger aspect ration and provides a toolbar with access to deeper features. And, Samsung also promises optimized viewing experience while using Gmail, YouTube, and Spotify.\n\nFurthermore, the Flex mode give\u2019s the Z Fold 2 a lot of versatility. You can have controls or settings on one of the displays and the content on the other side for maximum and efficient usage of the foldable screen.\n\nSamsung has mentioned that the Flex mode is supported by Samsung apps like Camera, Gallery, Video Player. Clock, and Calendar. Furthermore, YouTube and Google Duo also supports Flex mode. And, there will be more third-party apps in the future.\n\nBattery\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold is running a 4500 mAh battery which should be enough for a day of usage. It comes with 25W fast wired charging, fast wireless charging, and supports reverse charging too.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 Price in Nepal and Availability\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 is an upgrade of the Galaxy Fold that improves upon the weaknesses of the original Galaxy Fold.\n\nIts price is ofcourse ridiculous at 1999 USD and it\u2019s only for a handful of consumers who want to flaunt the latest and greatest. Also, this is a dual-purpose 2-in-1 tablet that can be a mobile phone. So, Samsung is really pushing towards the idea of a phone that can act as a tablet when need be.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 price starts at 1999 USD and will be available starting September 18. There\u2019s no word on its availability in Nepal from Samsung. But, this could make it to Nepal with limited availability.\n\nAlso, watch our Samsung Note 20 Ultra first look video!","title":"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 Launched, Costs A Whopping $1,999","url":"http://techlekh.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-price-nepal/","video":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/oX4AZgHl2EE?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent"]}
