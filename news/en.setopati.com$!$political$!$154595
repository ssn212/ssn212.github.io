The meeting at the PM's residence in Baluwatar has been adjourned in absence of Speaker Agni Sapkota.\n\nThe Constitutional Council chaired by the PM includes chief justice (CJ), House speaker and deputy speaker, National Assembly chairman and the main opposition leader.\n\nPM Oli, Nepali Congress (NC) President Sher Bahadur Deuba, CJ Cholendra Shumsher Rana and National Assembly Chairman Ganesh Timalsina were present in the meeting on Tuesday. Absence of Speaker Sapkota meant there was lack of quorum as the post of deputy speaker remains vacant leading to automatic adjournment of meeting.\n\nPM Oli has again called the meeting at five Tuesday evening.\n\nThe meeting was also called on Sunday but did not go ahead in absence of Speaker Sapkota, main opposition leader Sher Bahadur Deuba and others.\n\nSources attribute Sapkota's refusal to attend the meeting to the internal dispute in ruling CPN where Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal and others have allied against fellow Chairman and Prime Minister (PM) KP Sharma Oli.\n\nThey claim that the Constitutional Council meeting remains uncertain until the internal dispute in CPN is resolved as Sapkota is close to Dahal who is unhappy with Oli for convening the meeting amidst escalating internal dispute.\n\nDahal has accused Oli of trying to move forward allying with the main opposition leader to make constitutional appointments ignoring internal agreements in CPN.\n\nAlmost four dozen constitutional positions remain vacant in lack of agreement among different factions in the ruling CPN and main opposition Nepali Congress (NC) to share spoils.\n\nThe National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) are without chiefs, and four and two members respectively. Similarly, the Election Commission does not have two commissioners.\n\nThe National Women Commission, Dalit Commission and other bodies are also without office-bearers.","title":"Constitutional Council meeting adjourned until 5 pm in lack of quorum","url":"http://en.setopati.com/political/154595","video":[]}
