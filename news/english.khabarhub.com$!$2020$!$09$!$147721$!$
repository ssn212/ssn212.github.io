(File photo)\n\nKATHMANDU: Minister for Women, Children and Senior Citizens Leelanath Shrestha has said the government\u2019s sole efforts were not sufficient to end violence against women.\n\nIn an address to the national gathering of Federation of Community Forest Users\u2019 Nepal (FECOFUN) organized here today to mark the 16-day campaign against violence against women, the minister stressed that efforts from civil society, non-government organizations, society and individual self were essential to end violence. The event was held virtually.\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of grave concern that cases of several sorts of violence against women go up even during the COVID-19 pandemic\u201d, he said.\n\nMunicipality Association of Nepal Chair and Dhulikhel Municipality mayor Ashok Byanju was of the opinion that incidences of VAW would not reduce until co-existence of women and men was accepted.\n\nNGO Federation chair Jeetram Lama said men were also being subjugated to gender-based violence asserting that indulging in violence was not the trait of human beings.\n\nJoint Secretary at the Ministry of Forest and Environment Radha Wagle said despite being in the same government positions, women and men were treated differently and Women are given less respect and recognition.\n\nLikewise, Women rights activist Dr Renu Adhikari, said VAW would leave its multiple impact on women\u2019s life. Advocate Kumari Kharel said the implementation of laws against VAW was weaker, thus giving the leeway for committing the crime.\n\nFECOFUN chair Bharati Pathak viewed voices against violence should be stronger and collective. \u201cThe FECOFUN has since its establishment been advocating for 50 percent women representation in everywhere and for the elimination of all sorts of VAW. We continue raise our voices for equality until the situation gets changed.\u201d RSS","title":"Minister Shrestha stresses collective efforts to end VAW - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/09/147721/","video":[]}
