The minimum wage rule requires employers to pay allowances for housing and food as well if they don\u2019t provide those for their workers.\n\nAmnesty International praised the move as \u201can encouraging sign that Qatar may finally be heading in the right direction,\u201d although employers still can file criminal charges against \u201cabsconding\u201d employees, meaning those who left their jobs without permission.\n\n\u201cWe call on Qatar to go further with these reforms, including removing the charge of absconding, to make sure that the rights of all workers are fully protected,\u201d Amnesty official Steve Cockburn said in a statement.\n\nQatar, whose citizens enjoy one of the world\u2019s highest per-capita incomes due to its natural gas reserves, partially ended the \u201ckafala\u201d system in 2018. That system ties workers to their employers, who had say over whether they could leave their jobs or even the country.\n\nQatar is being transformed by a building boom fueled by its vast oil and natural gas wealth. Like other energy-rich Gulf nations with relatively small local populations, Qatar relies on well over a million guest workers, many of them drawn from South Asian nations including India and Nepal. Rights activists long have criticized the \u201ckafala\u201d system as allowing abuses of those foreign workers.\n\nThis comes as Qatar will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup in the Arabian Peninsula nation. Having the winning bid for the soccer tournament brought renewed attention to laborers\u2019 rights in Qatar.\n\nMeanwhile Sunday, the United Arab Emirates announced it now requires private employers to grant new fathers five paid days off after the birth of a child.","title":"Qatar 'dismantles' kafala employment system: ILO","url":"http://en.setopati.com/social/153792","video":[]}
