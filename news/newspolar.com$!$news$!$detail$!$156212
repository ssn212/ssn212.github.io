The siege left five people dead.\n\nMilitary personnel have flooded into Washington, where as many as 15,000 National Guard troops could be deployed.\n\nIn the US Capitol on Monday, where security has tightened substantially including a metal fence around the building, Republicans blocked immediate passage of the 25th Amendment resolution, forcing a debate and House vote.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi hit out at Republicans, accusing them of enabling Trump's \"unhinged, unstable and deranged acts of sedition to continue.\"\n\n\"Their complicity endangers America, erodes our Democracy, and it must end,\" she said in a statement.\n\nTrump has been largely silent in recent days, making few statements and holding no news conferences. He has been banned from Twitter, his favored public platform, for language that could incite violence.\n\nSupport appeared to be crumbling within his inner circle. Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security which safeguards the inauguration, resigned on Monday, the third cabinet member to quit since the riot.\n\nIn the Republican-controlled Senate, which is on recess until January 19, top Democrat Chuck Schumer is said to be considering a rarely used maneuver to force the chamber back into session under emergency circumstances to more quickly open an impeachment trial.\n\nBut some Democrats have expressed concern that a trial would hamper Biden's efforts to get his cabinet confirmed and quickly lay out his agenda, starting with the fight against the coronavirus pandemic and the need to support the economy.\n\nBiden, speaking in Delaware after receiving his second dose of the coronavirus vaccine, told reporters he was talking with congressional leaders to see if it were possible to \"bifurcate\" the process.\n\nHe proposed working \"half day on dealing with impeachment, and half day getting my people nominated and confirmed in the Senate as well as moving on the (economic) package.\"\n\n- 'Attempted coup' -\n\nThe attack on Congress shook the core of American democracy and drew international condemnation. Trump is accused of whipping up the mob into storming the chambers as lawmakers certified Biden's election win.\n\nTrump was already impeached once by the Democratic-controlled House in December 2019 for pressuring Ukraine's president to dig up political dirt on Biden. He was acquitted by the Republican-majority Senate.\n\nEven with time running short, House Democrats likely have the votes to impeach Trump again and congressman David Cicilline, who introduced the resolution, told reporters afterward he expects it will find Republican backing.\n\n\"This was an attempted coup to overthrow the government, and we have a responsibility as Congress to respond to that,\" said Cicilline.\n\nAlthough two Republican senators -- Pat Toomey and Lisa Murkowski -- have publicly called on Trump to resign, Democrats are unlikely to muster the two-thirds majority needed to convict Trump in the 100-member Senate and remove him from office.\n\nAny conviction would likely occur after he is no longer president, but it would disqualify Trump, who may consider a White House run in 2024, from holding public office again.","title":"Trump shores up Pence ties as Democrats move to impeach","url":"http://newspolar.com/news/detail/156212","video":[]}
