A victory over Vietnam to kick off the group stage was followed by draws against Netherlands and Portugal \u2014 barely enough to get the team into the knockout stage.\n\nThe Americans played well in the round of 16 against Sweden but ultimately fell on penalties after a scoreless tie. The U.S. scored just four goals over the course of the tournament.\n\nThe United States had never finished worse than third at previous World Cups.\n\nThe 46-year-old Andonovski was named coach of the United States in October 2019, taking over for Jill Ellis, who led the United States to back-to-back World Cup titles.\n\nHe finished 51-5-9 during his time with the team, and was 3-2-5 in major tournaments.\n\nFollowing the match against Sweden, Andonovski said he wasn\u2019t thinking about his future with the team \u2014 only his young players. Fourteen players on the roster were appearing in their first World Cup, and 12 of them had never played in a major tournament.\n\n\u201cWe spent four years together. They got their first caps with me, they got their first national team call-ups with me,\u201d Andonovski said. \u201cWe spent tough times, good times. I don\u2019t want to see them like that. That\u2019s all I think about.\u201d\n\nThe United States also finished with a disappointing bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics. Afterward, Andonovski turned his attention on developing young players ahead of the World Cup.\n\nSome of the players who emerged were Sophia Smith, last year\u2019s U.S. Soccer player of the year, and Trinity Rodman.\n\n(VOA/AP)","title":"US women\u2019s soccer coach resigns after early World Cup exit","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/18/314968/","video":[]}
