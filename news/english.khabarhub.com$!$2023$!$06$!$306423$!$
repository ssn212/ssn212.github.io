More recently, Pence testified before a grand jury investigating Trump.\n\nNow, Pence is hoping to convince Republican voters that he, not Trump nor an array of other declared or likely Republican candidates, deserve the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nBut national polls of Republicans show Trump, even as he faces multiple criminal investigations linked to his presidency, is far ahead in the nomination contest, with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in second place 30 percentage points or so behind, and Pence and others even further back with less than 5% support apiece.\n\nPence is formally announcing his presidential bid Wednesday, his 64th birthday, in the midwestern state of Iowa, whose Republican caucuses next year kick off the party\u2019s voting for the presidential nomination.\n\nHe made his candidacy official Monday by filing paperwork with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nPence, who has often described himself as \u201ca Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order,\u201d is planning to campaign extensively in Iowa, hoping to capture the votes of evangelical Christians who favor his staunch anti-abortion stance and other right-wing positions.\n\nIn early campaign jousting, he has portrayed himself as favoring many of the policy positions from his time in the White House with Trump, but with a reserved persona and absent the frequent chaos of the Trump presidency.\n\nPence has warned against the growing populist tide in the Republican Party, and advisers claim he is the only traditional, conservative in the race, reminiscent of the presidency of Ronald Reagan, the country\u2019s leader in the 1980s.\n\nAside from his conservative viewpoint on cultural issues, Pence has said the U.S. should offer more support to Ukraine against Russia\u2019s military invasion, while rebuking \u201cPutin apologists\u201d among Republicans unwilling to stand up against Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPence is joining a crowded field of Republican presidential candidates that includes Trump, DeSantis, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, U.S. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie plans to launch his own campaign Tuesday evening in New Hampshire, and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum is also announcing his bid Wednesday.\n\n(VOA)","title":"Mike Pence files paperwork to run for US President","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/06/306423/","video":[]}
