Three villages- Phechaha, Kolahawa and Labatoli- in the area lacked a school nearby. Children of the villages had to walk around two kilometers to reach a nearby school.\n\nOn a fine day, Yadav had a talk with Shuvakanta and Paramananda on establishing a school in the village, Kolahawa, that is located amid other two villages, Phechaha and Labatoli. As per the plan, the Paramananda's family had agreed to provide a plot of land for establishing a basic school at Tulasiyahi Nikas of Kolahawa.\n\n\u201cOur children had to walk around two kilometers to reach a nearby school (Baidyanath Dewananda Janata Secondary School) or elsewhere. It is much difficult for them during monsoon. So, we had dreamt of establishing a school to provide quality education to our children near to their place,\u201d said Yadav, 70, recalling the moment.\n\nManagement of a plot of land and other arrangements had been made. But, a lack of money to be put as collateral to open a basic school had hit their plan. All of the three and some other social workers and local politicians reached the district education office for the project get moving ahead. But, they returned empty-handed without the permission to run a school due to a lack of sufficient money to be put as collateral. \u201cMoney or land had to be put as collateral. We could not manage around Rs 500,000 for the same. Valuation of the land could not reach the limit point either. We returned empty-handed. However, we did not let our dream die,\u201d said Yadav.\n\nThey did not give up and constructed huts with corrugated zinc sheets with the hope of getting permission to run a basic school. \u201cWe brought together corrugated zinc sheets that were thrown away. We run classes for six months, but could not still acquire the licence. In the end, classes halted amid political turmoil,\u201d he said pointing at the huts.\n\nFor so long years in between, the huts remained neglected without conservation. No help came, and initiatives taken for its conservation. Many things changed in between. Shuvakanta died some seven years ago, and Paramananda some one and a half years ago, leaving the responsibility of keeping intact their dream of establishing a school on Yadav.\n\nOn a positive note, other people have associated with the project. One of them is Amresh Kanta Jha, son of Paramananda, who is a chartered accountant and a politician. With his help, the dream of the three has come into reality, as they recently got the licence to run a school under the name of 'Shree Saraswati Paramananda Basic School' in the area. The school will run classes up to three grades.\n\n\"I have been linked with the project as I felt it was my responsibility to bring my father's dream into reality. He (father) would be a happy lot if he were alive. People are mortal, but social works are immortal. So, we have donated two kaththa and six dhurs of land for the school. Now, not only my family and society, the entire government is connected with the school. I believe this project would take a bigger shape,\" said Amresh Kanta, who is also a patron founder of the school, at an event oragnised here on Friday to provide information about the formal operation of the school.\n\nAn agreement has been reached to provide quality education, and run English medium classes from preprimary level, and the rural municipality will manage three teachers.\n\n\"Education is the main pillar for social development. We are committed to provide quality education through a community school in a context when parents except compulsion tend to send their children to private schools,\" he said.\n\nChair of the rural municipality-4 Udaya Chandra Jha said that the local government would provide help, and initiatives be taken for the provincial and central governments to lend help as well.\n\nThe rural municipality chair Ajaya Kumar Yadav also pledged to provide physical and other assistances. Efforts are on to allocate Rs 3 million for the project through budget, policies and programmes for the current fiscal year, 2022/23, he said. The school aims to provide education to over 500 children from the villages.\n\nLocal political parties have also showed their interest in providing assistances for the project.\n\nJanata Samajwadi Party leader Ashok Kumar Jha said local political parties had come together to provide assistances for the school.\n\nLocal children are a happy lot after getting a school in their access. One of them is Bimalesh Kumar Yadav, who is pursuing grades four at a private school, around two kilometers away.\n\n\"I do not know I get enrolled in the school this year. A school in one's easy access is a matter of happiness for my siblings and other children,\" he said.\n\n\"Now, this school rids us of hardship required for us to reach far away schools,\" shared Chanchal Kumari Yadav, a one grader at a private school.\n\nAmresh Kanta carrying tears of joy pointing at children play nearby during the event said, \"See! How children are happy. There will be a big pressure of children when each of around 700 families here sends their children to the school. We will win hearts of the parents through a quality education.\"\n\nThere will not be a lack of space for a large number of children (if any), he ensured. He has around two and a half bighas of land in his family name around the school. \"I will manage additional land for the school if need be. We will not let any problem affect the school. Help of all is in need,\" he said.\n\n\"If Paramananda and Shuvakanta (two of the three persons who dreamt of the project) were alive now, they would be very much happy for me. Now, their contributions will become immortal. I want to wish to see the school going through changes in my life. Let's see how things unfold,\" said Yadav.","title":"Dream of establishing community school in rural Dhanusa village comes into reality after 18 years","url":"http://english.lokaantar.com/news/detail/33129","video":[]}
