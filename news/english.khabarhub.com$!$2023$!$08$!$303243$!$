It remains around two months for the current FY to be over.\n\nThe issue of increasing expenditures as compared to incomes is a major concern, he said.\n\n\u201cThere are major challenges in reducing the gap of budget deficit. There is a big gap between loan investments and economic growths. Loan rates are regularly increasing 20 or 22 percent. But, this has not significantly contributed to economic growths, it seems,\u201d he said.","title":"Govt\u2019s efforts for economic improvements inadequate: Dr Swarnim Wagle","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/08/303243/","video":[]}
