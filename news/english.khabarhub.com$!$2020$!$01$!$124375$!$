President Bhandari instead performed atonement worship at the office of the President -Shital Niwas- for her inability to perform puja and observe the chariot procession due to risks of spread of the COVID-19.\n\nGuthi Sansthan Kathmandu Chapter Chief Hari Prasad Subedi shared that President Bhandari performed atonement puja to Lord Ganesh, Bhairav and Goddess Kumari at her office.\n\nThe annual tradition is an eight-day affair that officially began today. Basantapur Durbar Square Area donned a deserted look this year due to the prohibitory order to contain the COVID-19 transmission at the community level.\n\nSuman Khadgi, a local of Kathmandu Metropolitan City 19, shared that as his family and him, others also kept themselves indoors and worshiped and celebrated the festival at homes to stay safe from transmission of the flu-like infection.
