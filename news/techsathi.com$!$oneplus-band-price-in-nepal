Now, the company has entered into wearable market with the launch of much anticipated OnePlus Band. This is a fitness tracker that provides most of the features that the competitors in the market provide, like sleep monitoring and activity tracking. Being priced reasonably, the band seems to be getting much attention in it\u2019s early phase. So, let\u2019s take a look at OnePlus Band with specifications and price in Nepal.\n\nOnePlus Band Overview\n\nThe band offers pretty much the same design we\u2019ve seen recently as in Mi Band 5. It\u2019s got rectangular watch face design, which looks ok. The strap is removable and the material is silicon, but feels premium with smooth texture finish. We get three color options in strap, Black, Navy, and Tangerine Gray.\n\nDisplay & Weight\n\nThe net weight of device is 22.6g, which is on the lighter side. It offers 1.1-inch AMOLED 126 x 294 resolution screen with 100% P3 color gamut. However, OnePlus hasn\u2019t provided always-on display feature. So, you will have to use raise-to-awake feature.\n\nFeatures\n\nLet\u2019s move into the most important features of the band. It provides you with lots and lots of features to keep track of your health. The heart rate sensor on the band tracks your heart rate 24 hours, in certain intervals to let you know if you have irregular heart rate while resting. However, the stress alert is not available on it as we\u2019ve seen on Mi Band 5. The band keeps track of your movement and tells you all the data, like calories burned, indoor run, outdoor run, movements during cricket, badminton, cycling, swimming (IP68 resistant), etc. with total of 13 exercise modes. The sleep monitoring feature helps you keep record of sleep quality and deep sleep.\n\nUnlike Mi Band 5, there is SPO2 sensor to measure oxygen level. This is very helpful, especially when you are in a gym, exercise, running or doing any physical activities. Experts believe it could also detect corona virus cases, as the ones who are infected tend to have lower oxygen level and difficulty in breathing. But, the device should not be your only guide to detect the virus.\n\nTotal of just 37 watch faces are available as of now. But, the faces can easily be added in the future with updates (hopefully). The battery on the device is 100mAh. OnePlus claims that the battery should last up to 14 days. Sadly, there is no magnetic charger like on Mi Band 5. So, you have to take out the tracker from the strap in order to charge. This feature alone can lose many customers as the competition is too tight in the budget. Also, the band doesn\u2019t work for iOS and works only for Android version 6.0+.\n\nSpecifications\n\nDimensions & Weight 40.4mm x 17.6mm x 11.45mm (Main Tracker)\n\n40.4mm x 17.6mm x 11.95mm (Including heart rate sensor)\n\n257mm x 21.0mm x 0.7mm (Band Strap only)\n\n22.6g Display 1.1\u2033 AMOLED\n\n126 x 294 pixels\n\nAnti-scratch Coating Sensors Blood Oxygen Sensor\n\n3-axis accelerometer\n\nGyroscope\n\nOptical heart rate sensor Exercise Modes Outdoor Run, Indoor Run, Fat Burn Run, Outdoor Walk, Outdoor Cycling, Indoor Cycling, Elliptical Trainer, Rowing Machine, Cricket, Badminton, Pool Swimming, Yoga, Free Training.

If it is launched at NPR. 4,200, the band could give good competition to the competitors in the market.","title":"OnePlus Band Launched With 14 Days Battery & SPO2 Sensor","url":"http://techsathi.com/oneplus-band-price-in-nepal","video":[]}
