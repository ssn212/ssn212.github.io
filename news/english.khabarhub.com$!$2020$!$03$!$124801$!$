He said they were happy to respect one of the War heroes.\n\nGurkha Welfare Trust\u2019s Adam Bentham shared that the Gurkha soldiers had played a crucial role in the World War, saying seven VCs were awarded to soldiers fighting in the Second World War in Burma alone and Pun was one of them.\n\n\u201cOur country owes a lot to the Gurkhas. We have taken this honor as true respect,\u201d Bentham remarked.\n\nJoana Lumley said she could not forget her meeting with VC Tul Bahadur Pun and Lachhiman Gurung, who fought in the War in Burma together with her father, and that the British people were indebted to their contribution for independence, rising above their job. Lumley is the patron of the trust that put forth the ex-Gurkha soldiers\u2019 demands before the British government and continued the struggle for equal pay.\n\nLate in his life, Pun had worked together with Lumley remaining at the forefront. Lumley was leading the campaign for providing UK residence to the former British Gurkhas\u2019 families.\n\nPun was born in Myagdi district of Nepal on March 23, 1923. He passed away in Parbat district, Nepal on April 20, 2011.
