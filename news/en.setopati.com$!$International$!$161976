Security Council failed again Wednesday to address the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza, rejecting rival United States and Russian resolutions.\n\nThe council is the U.N.\u2019s most powerful body, charged with maintaining international peace and security, but its divisions have left it impotent and scrambling to try to find a resolution with acceptable language.\n\nThe resolution drafted by the United States, Israel\u2019s closest ally, would have reaffirmed Israel\u2019s right to self-defense, urged respect for international laws \u2014 especially protection of civilians \u2014 and called for \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d to deliver desperately needed aid to Gaza.\n\nIn Wednesday\u2019s vote in the 15-member council, 10 countries voted in favor, Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates voted against, and Brazil and Mozambique abstained. The resolution was not adopted because permanent council members Russia and China cast vetoes.\n\nThe Russian resolution, which was then put to a vote, would have called for an immediate \u201chumanitarian cease-fire\u201d and unequivocally condemned Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attacks in Israel and \u201cindiscriminate attacks\u201d on civilians and civilian objects in Gaza.\n\nIn that vote, four countries voted in favor \u2013 Russia, China, United Arab Emirates and Gabon. The United States and United Kingdom voted against, and nine countries abstained. The resolution wasn\u2019t adopted because it failed to get the minimum nine \u201cyes\u201d votes.\n\nThe failure of the two resolutions followed the council\u2019s rejections last week of a Russian resolution that didn\u2019t mention Hamas and also failed to get nine \u201cyes\u201d votes and a widely supported Brazilian resolution vetoed by the United States that would have condemned the Hamas attacks and all violence against civilians and called for \u201chumanitarian pauses.\u201d\n\nAfter the votes, Malta\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Vanessa Frazier, speaking on behalf of the 10 elected members of the council serving two-year terms, announced they will be working on a new proposal in the coming days.\n\n\u201cAs elected members of this council, we also represent the rest of the international community and we have a duty and an obligation to act,\u201d she told the council. \u201cThere is no time to waste.\u201d\n\nBefore the vote, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the council that last week she had said diplomacy needed to play out before it approved a resolution. She pointed to action by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, President Joe Biden, and regional leaders that led to the opening of the Rafah crossing from Egypt to Gaza to the delivery of some desperately needed humanitarian aid, though \u201cmuch, much more help is needed\u201d as well as the release of four of the more than 200 hostages taken from Israel.\n\nThomas-Greenfield called this moment a test for the international community and for the council. She accused Russia of introducing a resolution at the last minute \u201cin bad faith\u201d with no consultations, and urged members to vote for the \u201cstrong and balanced\u201d U.S. text.\n\nRussia\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia countered that an immediate humanitarian cease-fire is needed to de-escalate the conflict and reduce the bloodshed and \u201cshocking\u201d Palestinian casualties. He called the U.S. draft \u201cpoliticized\u201d and claimed the United States doesn\u2019t want the Security Council to have any influence on a possible Israeli ground offensive that \u201cwould risk provoking an even larger-scale conflict in the region and possibly even beyond.\u201d\n\nAfter the vote, China\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun said the U.S. draft contained many elements that went beyond humanitarian needs and were \u201cdeeply divisive.\u201d He called it \u201cevasive on the most urgent issue of ending the fighting\u201d and said it failed to reflect the world\u2019s strong calls for a cease-fire.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh, the Arab representative on the council who voted against the U.S. resolution and for the Russian draft, said the U.N. and humanitarian organizations have made clear that what is essential is a humanitarian cease-fire, the release of all hostages, and sustained humanitarian access to Gaza.\n\nAt a council meeting on the war Tuesday that heard nearly 90 speakers, there were \u201cdozens of statements imploring this council to assign the same value to Palestinian life as it does to Israeli life,\u201d Nusseibeh said. \u201cWe cannot allow any equivocation on this point.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan thanked the U.S. and other nations that supported its resolution for condemning \u201csavage genocidal terrorists while standing up for the values of freedom and security.\u201d\n\nThose who voted against the resolution showed the world the Security Council is incapable of condemning \u201cterrorists and cannot confirm the right to self -defense of the victim of these heinous crimes.\u201d\n\nRiyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, told the Associated Press after the vote \u201cit\u2019s disgusting the Security Council is not shouldering its responsibility\u201d to \u201cstop the war.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not start by killing the people and then say that I want to deal with the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to save lives. \u2026 That is the most urgent priority.\u201d\n\nWith the Security Council still paralyzed, the Palestinians are turning to the 193-member General Assembly where there are no vetoes \u2014 just as Ukraine did after Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion. The assembly\u2019s emergency special session opens Thursday, with 106 speakers on the list, and Arab nations have circulated a draft resolution which Mansour said he expects to be put to a vote on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe draft resolution calls for an immediate cease-fire, demands that Israel rescind its order for Gazans to move from the north to the south, calls for maximum restraint, and demands that essential goods including food, water and medicine are provided in the Gaza Strip.","title":"UN Security Council fails again to address Israel-Hamas war, rejecting US and Russian resolutions","url":"http://en.setopati.com/International/161976","video":[]}
