Outgoing Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his government have been given three days to name an interim leader.\n\nAn Election Commission of Pakistan official told the BBC: \"The elections will be held once the census is done, which will take about four months' time. As a result, the elections may be delayed till next year.\"\n\nSharif, who warned that the country cannot progress without \"national unity\", also told reporters recently that polls may not be held this year.\n\nSome feel the election is being delayed as the ruling Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) coalition isn't confident about winning at the polls, due to Khan's enduring popularity, as well as the effects of runaway inflation despite a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.\n\nDespite their once-close relationship, Khan has rattled the military like no other politician before him. Senior analyst Rasool Bakhsh Raees even reckons that the former cricket star's detention will increase his popularity.\n\nIn May, Khan's arrest on corruption charges sparked nationwide protests that saw at least eight deaths and some 1,400 arrests, amid unprecedented attacks on military property and buildings.\n\nThe 70-year-old, who is appealing his conviction on graft charges, has claimed that the military's goal was to \"eventually put me into prison and to crush my party.\"\n\nBut the rule remains the same: anyone who challenges Pakistan's military, even someone with the charisma and international stature of Khan, must go. The former cricket star is simply the latest politician since the 1970s to find this out the hard way.\n\nAs former senator Afrasiab Khattak told the BBC, there are two systems of government operating in parallel. Now, \"the unsanctioned, de facto force wants to take over the parliamentary process,\" said Khattak. \"Pakistan's military has always been powerful, but they want more powers so that their unsanctioned rule is not challenged either by politicians, activists, or journalists.\"\n\nTwo draconian laws were tabled in the National Assembly last week, in a bid to further enhance the powers of the military and intelligence agencies.\n\nProposed amendments to the century-old Official Secrets Act will broadly empower the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) to arrest citizens over \"suspected breach of official secrets\". In addition, a new bill recommends a three-year jail term for anyone who discloses the identity of an intelligence official.\n\nThe amendments provoked a ruckus in parliament, with both the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and PML-N's coalition partners calling the government out for passing \"draconian laws in haste\" and without discussion.\n\nSenator Mushtaq Ahmed of Jamaat-e-Islami also warned that the Official Secrets Act amendment will grant intelligence agencies \"extraordinary powers\" of arrest and search without a warrant. \"This will have an impact on the human rights, individual rights and press freedom across the country.\"\n\nThe Pakistani intelligence services are regularly accused of illegally detaining opposition members, politicians, activists and journalists, with human rights organisations noting the increasing number of enforced disappearances every month.\n\nIn the month of July alone, 157 more cases of enforced disappearances were reported, according to the government-led Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances.\n\nThe bills have been sent to President Alvi, a co-founder of the PTI, and must be signed by him before they can be legislated into law.\n\n(BBC)","title":"Pakistan: Election delayed in latest political crisis","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/29540/election-delayed-","video":[]}
