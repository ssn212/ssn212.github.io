Jean Carroll, now 79, that Trump raped her in the dressing room of an upscale department store in New York sometime in 1996. But it concluded that he sexually abused her, awarding her $2 million on that allegation.\n\nIt awarded Carroll another $3 million for Trump\u2019s repeated claims publicly and on his social media accounts that her allegations were \u201ca scam\u201d and \u201ca complete con job.\u201d\n\nCarroll emerged from the courthouse smiling but did not stop to talk to a gaggle of news reporters.\n\nA woman yelled to her, \u201cYou\u2019re so brave and beautiful,\u201d to which Carroll said, \u201cThank you, thank you so much.\u201d\n\nLater, she said in a statement, \u201cI filed this lawsuit against Donald Trump to clear my name and to get my life back. Today, the world finally knows the truth. This victory is not just for me but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed.\u201d\n\n\u2018Bogus case\u2019\n\nTrump slammed the decision, insisting he is the subject of a witch hunt.\n\n\u201cThis verdict is a disgrace \u2014 a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time,\u201d the former president posted, using all capital letters, on his Truth Social media platform.\n\n\u201cI have absolutely no idea who this woman is,\u201d he said of Carroll.\n\nThe Trump campaign promoting his 2024 run for the Republican presidential nomination said, \u201cMake no mistake, this entire bogus case is a political endeavor targeting President Trump because he is now an overwhelming front-runner to be once again elected president of the United States.\u201d\n\nTrump defense lawyer Joseph Tacopina said the former president would appeal the outcome, with the lawyer adding that he believes there are \u201cplenty of issues\u201d on which to try to overturn the verdict.\n\nTacopina said he does not believe Trump can get a fair trial in New York, which, even though Trump grew up and lived in the city for decades, voted overwhelmingly against him in his two previous campaigns for the White House.\n\nTrump lost his 2020 reelection bid to Democrat Joe Biden and now is facing several criminal investigations stemming from his efforts to overturn that election outcome and his retention of classified documents from his presidency at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\nBut the allegations made by Carroll were adjudicated in a civil, not criminal case, and as a result carried no threat of a conviction or imprisonment for the 76-year-old Trump.\n\nInstead, the jury had to decide by a unanimous vote whether there was a preponderance of evidence to believe Carroll\u2019s contention that after a chance encounter with Trump at Bergdorf Goodman, he lured her into a dressing room in the lingerie department, quickly pinned her against a wall, pulled down her tights, opened his pants, and sexually assaulted her.\n\nTwo testify Trump assaulted them\n\nTrump did not appear in the courtroom to hear Carroll\u2019s account nor was he required to. Two other women testified on her behalf that Trump assaulted them decades ago in similar fashion: A onetime stock broker said he groped her in the first-class cabin of a New York-bound flight, and a journalist alleged that he suddenly started kissing her at Mar-a-Lago while she was there to report a story for People magazine on the first anniversary of his marriage to his third wife, former first lady Melania Trump.\n\nTacopina called no defense witnesses in the case and instead tried to chip away at Carroll\u2019s account of the incident, noting that she could not remember the exact date the attack occurred, never reported it to police at the time nor went to a hospital for treatment, and only first made her allegation public in a 2019 memoir.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most ridiculous, disgusting story. It\u2019s just made up,\u201d Tacopina told the jurors in his closing argument on Monday. Earlier, as the case opened two weeks ago, Tacopina said, \u201cThere are no witnesses to call to prove a negative\u201d and that jurors would have to \u201cbelieve the unbelievable\u201d to rule in favor of Carroll, who sought a retraction of Trump\u2019s denial of the incident and unspecified monetary damages.\n\nOn the witness stand, Carroll gave a searing account of her encounter with Trump, even as she acknowledged she could not precisely pinpoint the date it occurred, although trial testimony indicated it might have been in the spring of 1996 on an early Thursday evening when the store was open later for shoppers.\n\nCarroll testified that Trump used his weight to pin her against the dressing room enclosure.\n\n\u201cI was pushing him back,\u201d she said. \u201cI was almost too frightened to think.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis fingers went into my vagina, which was extremely painful,\u201d Carroll said. Then, she said, he inserted his penis, before she said she used her knee to push him away and fled.\n\nShe said that she was so traumatized by the incident that \u201cit left me unable to ever have a romantic life again.\u201d\n\nIn a taped video deposition from last October that Carroll\u2019s lawyers showed jurors, Trump claimed that he would not have attacked Carroll, once an Indiana University cheerleader and beauty queen at the school, because she was not his type. But he undercut his claim when he was shown a picture of himself with Carroll at a New York social event in the 1970s: He misidentified her as his second wife, Marla Maples, while acknowledging all three of his wives were the type of women he was attracted to.\n\nCarroll\u2019s lawyers also showed jurors the 2005 video from the celebrity TV show \u201cAccess Hollywood,\u201d in which Trump claimed that women allowed him to start kissing them and grabbing them by their genitals because he was a star.\n\nCarroll lawyer Roberta Kaplan said Trump may not have appeared in court to testify in the case, but contended in her closing statement to the jurors that the videotape showed how he treated women.\n\n\u201cWhat is he doing here?\u201d Kaplan asked jurors. \u201cHe is telling you in his own words his modus operandi, his M.O. \u2026 he kissed them without their consent. The evidence shows overwhelmingly he followed this playbook and in the dressing room \u2026 grabbed\u201d Carroll and assaulted her.\n\n(VOA)","title":"Jury finds Trump sexually abused woman decades ago","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/10/303367/","video":[]}
