He has claimed his ouster was illegal and a Western conspiracy and has campaigned against the government of his successor, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, demanding early elections.\n\nChaudhry said Khan was dragged out of the court and into a police vehicle. He said the former premier is now in the custody of the security forces. He denounced the arrest as \u201can abduction.\u201d\n\nPakistan\u2019s independent GEO TV broadcast images of Khan being pulled by security forces towards an armored vehicle, which took him away.\n\nKhan\u2019s party immediately complained to the Islamabad High Court, which requested a police report explaining the charges for Khan\u2019s arrest.\n\nOfficials from the anti-corruption body said that Pakistan\u2019s National Accountability Bureau had issued arrest warrants for Khan last week in a separate graft case, for which he had not obtained bail \u2014 something that would protect him from arrest under the country\u2019s laws.\n\nThe officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Khan will be brought to appear before an anti-graft tribunal later on Tuesday.","title":"Imran Khan arrested in court in Islamabad: Party officials","url":"http://en.setopati.com/International/161020","video":[]}
