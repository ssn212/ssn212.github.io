The Manipur government would consult all stakeholders before taking a decision on the matter, he said.\n\nThousands of troops have been deployed in the state to maintain order and a curfew is in place in several districts and internet access has been suspended. Last week, the state's governor issued \"shoot-on-sight\" orders in \"extreme cases\" to bring the situation under control.\n\nMore than 23,000 civilians have been rescued and moved to temporary shelters, the army said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nThe evacuees include a large number of women and children.\n\nLocals say they are worried about their future. \"We don't feel safe right now,\" L Sanglun Simte, a resident of the state capital Imphal, told AFP news agency. The 29-year-old Kuki has been camping outside Imphal airport with 11 of his family members.\n\nThe army on Sunday said that there had been a lull in the fighting after soldiers worked \"tirelessly for the past 96 hours to rescue civilians across all communities, curb violence and restore normalcy\".\n\nBut the situation is still tense in several parts of the state.\n\nWhile local residents remain in army shelters, other states have sent rescue teams to get their people out of Manipur.\n\nSome states like Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh have arranged special flights for the evacuees.\n\nThe violence began last Wednesday. Mobs vandalised vehicles and burned homes and shops in Imphal, and several other districts.\n\nVideo and photos showed buildings set on fire, with thick black smoke engulfing the streets.\n\nThe army says it is bringing the situation under control.\n\nOn Monday, people came out to buy food and medicines after curfews were relaxed for a few hours in the affected areas, news agency PTI reported.\n\n(BBC)","title":"Manipur: Thousands displaced as ethnic clashes grip north-eastern state","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/27669/ethnic-clashes-grip-north-eastern-state-","video":[]}
