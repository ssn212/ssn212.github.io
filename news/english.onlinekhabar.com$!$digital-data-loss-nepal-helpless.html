Initially reported as a simple technical problem, the NITC later reported that it lost data from various government agencies.\n\nStating that digital data loss was due to technical reasons, the NITC has not been able to find out how many details they lost and how.\n\nThe NITC\u2019s list of responsibilities is long. It has been tasked with the responsibility of storing, managing and processing government data along with ensuring its safety. It also needs to provide shared computing resources, consult the government on various IT-related issues, register government domains and manage government networks.\n\nAt the same time, the NITC\u2013which helps the government in training officials, collocation of services, virtualisation, cloud services, web hosting and software development\u2013has termed the latest incident as a machinery problem.\n\nPradip Paudel, the NTNC executive director, says that there was a problem in some parts of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of a server, leading to digital data loss, and efforts are being made to recover the data with global support.\n\nBut the employees of the centre say they do not know how many government bodies have been affected by the digital data lass loss incident. They say they will only know when the concerned government bodies will inform them about their data being lost.\n\nHelpless government\n\nFile: The front side of Singhadarbar, the central administrative complex of Nepal\n\nAn official says it has been confirmed that many local level data including that of the Public Service Commission, Department of Health Service and Gorkhapatra have been lost. However, it is not clear which details of which agencies were deleted.\n\nPaudel claims that the data of about 10-15 agencies were lost. However, he cannot reveal the exact number.\n\nIt is not certain whether the lost information will be recovered. The centre claims it has been trying to recover lost data with help from a foreign expert for over a month.\n\nThe NITC says efforts are being made to recover the data with the help of Oracle International, but sources say it is almost impossible to solve the problem.\n\n\u201cExperts have said that this kind of digital data loss is something that has not happened in the world,\u201d says one of the technicians at the centre. \u201cWe will try for one more week to recover data, but things do not look likely.\u201d\n\nThis has started to affect the performance of various government agencies. According to the Public Service Commission, data about more than 85,000 examinees preparing for the various examinations are missing. This has resulted in the commission postponing the exams by three weeks; it has asked applicants to fill out the form again.\n\nToya Narayan Subedi, the spokesperson of the commission, says that the data of those who filled out the online form for the exams between November 2022 and March 2023 have been lost.\n\nThe commission is facing issues as it does not even have data on people who have paid the examination fees and has asked those who applied to submit their vouchers when submitting the form.\n\n\u201cBecause all the details were lost, it took time for us to identify the examinees,\u201d says Subedi. \u201dThe details of applicants who paid are at the Office of the Comptroller General and we are using that to identify who has paid and who hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAnother employee of the commission says that the exams, scheduled to begin on May 27, will have to be postponed for at least a month or two as it needs to carry out various preparations.\n\n\u201cAlthough the efforts are ongoing, the commission has not received information about when the data will be recovered from the NITC. The commission is working on an alternative plan to conduct the examinations of pre-published advertisements,\u201d read a statement issued by the commission.\n\nAccording to the Public Service Commission, since 2012, all the details have been kept in the NITC data centre at Singhadarbar. Now with the digital data loss, the commission does not know what to do and is looking at alternative options.\n\nWhose fault?\n\nPublic Service Commission\n\nNarayan Neupane, an information technology expert working in the field of data storage and management, says both NITC and the commission are at fault for the recent case of digital data loss.\n\n\u201cThe NITC should have kept a backup,\u201d he says. \u201cEven the technicians of the commissions should have made a clear policy regarding the need to back up its data.\u201d\n\nThe latest incident is proof of how weak the technical capacity of the NITC is and how that has compromised the data security in the country.\n\nOfficials of the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology say that if the data centre took the issue of government servers going down on January 28 seriously, this particular issue of digital data loss could have been dealt with differently. However, they believe since the data centre is operated in a sloppy manner, it faces regular problems.\n\nSystems handled by the NITC face regular issues. The servers go down frequently as does the internet while the websites are either down or operate very slowly.\n\nThe recent case of the government\u2019s digital data loss is clear that the centre is losing its credibility.\n\nExperts say a suitable mechanism for multilateral analysis and resolution of data security has not been created at the centre. Because of this, the report of the Office of the Auditor General in 2022 pointed out that the risk of cyber threats such as piracy, hacking, viruses, phishing, and malware was increasing.\n\nPaudel of the NITC says not all data are backed up.\n\n\u201cDigital data loss is not only our concern; it is also the responsibility of those whose data have been lost,\u201d says Paudel. \u201cAll we do is provide servers and resources. It is not just up to us to protect these data.\u201d\n\nHe says that another server has been given to the agencies including the Public Service Commission, and adds these agencies should also be responsible for protecting their own data.\n\nThe storage network established in 2011 is now called Government Integrated Data Centre (GIDC). There is also a Disaster Recovery Centre which has been operating since May 14, 2019, in Hetauda, Makawanpur, so that all data is not destroyed if there is a problem. But Paudel says even the Disaster Recovery Centre does not back up all data.\n\n\u201cIf they write to us asking us to back up their data, we do so; otherwise we don\u2019t,\u201d says Paudel.\n\nMismanagement galore\n\nThe NITC does not keep records of the equipment at offices and agencies it is providing its services. It does not even analyse how much the capacity of the server is and how much the capacity should be in that server according to the customer pressure.\n\nIt does not even regularly update the software and hardware it has purchased, which is also a major concern responsible for digital data loss, say officials.\n\nThe information technology audit conducted by the Office of the Auditor General has pointed out the state of negligence at the centre.\n\nAccording to the report, the centre does not have the details of the number agency it provided colocation services to.\n\nInternal system audits and regular technical audits of the data centre have not been done regularly either. The quality testing and levelling of organisations such as data centres, which store very important and confidential information of all government agencies and provide essential services, have not even been done. The centre has not made arrangements for multilateral and multi-level data security to meet international security standards either.\n\nInformation technology expert Manohar Bhattarai says that the centre is operating without a reliable data security and access policy.\n\n\u201cThere are international standards, practices and accreditations for data centre operations. If there are risks when following all of it, imagine what can happen if you don\u2019t follow it?\u201d he questions.\n\nIt is recognised that server security should be guaranteed by conducting national or internationally recognised tests such as an ISO 27001 certificate. For that, the centre has not shown interest in conducting regular internal and external tests.\n\nCyber and physical security risks at the data centre have not been detected by the NITC due to a lack of technical testing by external agencies.\n\nData protection has not been done according to international standards in infrastructure quality, environment, security, access or disaster management.\n\nMost of the human resources employed at the data centre are temporary. Many do not have specific qualifications, skills, and expertise. Sources say the centre does not have staff that are knowledgeable about networking, database, cooling, power and other infrastructure.\n\nMost of the work is put on computer engineers and whenever there are problems, it is forced to seek services from external parties.\n\nBhattarai sees the government slipping in terms of IT infrastructure management and security despite regular digital data loss.\n\n\u201cData security can only be achieved if there is a combination of appropriate laws, organisational structure, technology and its management,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIn the changing times, the protection of the country\u2019s borders should not be the only concern when it comes to national security,\u201d he says. \u201cSince there is so much dependence on technology, including the financial sector, the security of the data held by the government is also an equally important issue.\u201d\n\nThis story was translated from the original Nepali version and edited for clarity and length.","title":"Digital data loss is troubling Nepal in front of the helpless government","url":"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/digital-data-loss-nepal-helpless.html","video":[]}
