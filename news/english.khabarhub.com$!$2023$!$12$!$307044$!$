Security Council\u2019s Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team released earlier this month.\n\nIt said that under reclusive supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, the Taliban had \u201creverted to the exclusionary, Pashtun-centered, autocratic policies\u201d of their previous rule in Kabul from 1996-2001. The Taliban come from the majority ethnic Pashtun Afghans and their critics say other ethnicities lack representation in their administration.\n\nThe assessment said that \u201csome dissent is apparent within the Taliban leadership,\u201d but the authority of Akhundzada was increasing, and \u201ccohesion\u201d in Taliban ranks would likely be maintained over the next one to two years.\n\nThe Taliban chief has been \u201cproudly resistant to external pressure to moderate his policies,\u201d and other leaders in his administration could not \u201cinfluence policy sustainability.\u201d The report noted \u201clittle prospect of change in the near to medium term.\u201d\n\nMujahid rejected the U.N. allegations, saying the Taliban make all decisions in line with \u201cIslamic Sharia guidelines.\u201d He said the report\u2019s authors \u201cdeliberately distorted the facts\u201d or lacked access to the information.\n\n\u201cRumors of disagreement between the leaders of the Islamic Emirate, in particular, are a continuation of the propaganda of the past twenty years,\u201d Mujahid stated, using the official title of the Taliban government.\n\nAkhundzada is based in the southern city of Kandahar, Afghanistan\u2019s second largest, and rarely leaves what is known as the birthplace of the Taliban. The report described him as \u201creclusive and elusive.\u201d\n\nThrough several decrees, the Taliban chief has imposed sweeping restrictions on Afghan women, barring most of them from work, public spaces, and university education. He has also banned teenage girls nationwide from attending schools beyond the sixth grade.\n\nThe Taliban recently also instructed international charities to cease all educational activities for Afghan children, a move the U.N. denounced as another \u201chorrendous step backward\u201d for the people of Afghanistan.\n\nAkhundzada has rejected international criticism of his government and calls for removing curbs on women as interfering in Afghan matters.\n\nThe report cited an unnamed U.N. Security Council member as saying the \u201creclusive and elusive\u201d Taliban chief suffers from kidney problems and survived two spells of COVID-19 infection, weakening his respiratory system.\n\nLast month, Akhundzada reportedly held a secret meeting with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani in Kandahar. Neither side confirmed the interaction that reportedly took place on May 12 and focused on the need to lift bans on women and promote Kabul\u2019s engagement with the global community. The talks would have marked the first time the Taliban chief is known to have had with a foreign leader.\n\nRise in terrorism\n\nThe U.N. report alleged that terrorists had \u201cgreater freedom of maneuver\u201d in Afghanistan since the Taliban reclaimed control in August 2021 after waging a deadly insurgency against the United States-led NATO forces for almost two decades. It added that the Taliban\u2019s link \u201cremains strong and symbiotic\u201d with terrorist groups such as al-Qaida and the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP.\n\n\u201cThere are indications that al-Qaida is rebuilding operational capability, that TTP is launching attacks into Pakistan with support from the Taliban, that groups of foreign terrorist fighters are projecting threats across Afghanistan\u2019s borders, and that the operations of ISIL-K are becoming more sophisticated and lethal,\u201d the report said using an acronym for Islamic State\u2019s regional affiliate, Islamic State-Khorasan.\n\nMujahid said the Taliban are not allowing anyone to use Afghan territory against other countries.\n\n\u201cThe Islamic Emirate emphasizes that the publication of such biased and baseless reports by the Security Council does not help Afghanistan and international peace and security; rather, it increases worry among the people and raises doubts about the independence and impartiality of the United Nations.\u201d\n\nAuthorities in neighboring Pakistan have repeatedly complained about a rise in TTP-led cross-border attacks, saying the leadership of the so-called Pakistani Taliban is directing terrorism against the country from Afghan sanctuaries.\n\nThe violence has killed hundreds of Pakistanis, mostly security forces. The latest TTP attack occurred in North Waziristan, a volatile remote district on the Afghan border, killing three soldiers and three militants, according to a military statement.\n\n(VOA)","title":"Taliban rebuke UN over claims of internal rifts, terror links","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2023/12/307044/","video":[]}
