(File Photo: AFP)\n\nWASHINGTON: U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s top intelligence official is calling out China, describing the government in Beijing as the most pressing threat to freedom and democracy since the Second World War.\n\nThe warning from Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe is not the first of its kind from top U.S. intelligence or law enforcement officials, who for years have cautioned that China\u2019s expanding economic and military strength presented a growing danger to the United States. But this call to action may be the most dire.\n\n\u201cBeijing is preparing for an open-ended period of confrontation with the U.S.,\u201d Ratcliffe wrote in an opinion piece published late Thursday by The Wall Street Journal. \u201cWashington should also be prepared.\u201d\n\nRatcliffe, who was sworn in this past May after narrowly winning confirmation in the U.S. Senate, has consistently named China as one of his top intelligence priorities.\n\nBut in the months leading up to November\u2019s presidential election, he repeatedly clashed with Democratic lawmakers, some of whom criticized him for promoting a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d by insisting China was a greater threat than Russia.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to minimize Russia,\u201d Ratcliffe told Fox Business News this past August, defending his record. \u201cBut the threats that we face from China are significantly greater \u2026 anyone who sees intelligence knows that.\u201d\n\nEconomic, technological, military threats\n\nUntil now, many of the warnings from intelligence and law enforcement officials have focused on China\u2019s efforts to overtake the U.S. economy.\n\nAccording to the FBI, the number of economic espionage cases involving China has risen by about 1,300% over the past decade.\n\nAs of July, the bureau said it was investigating more than 1,000 cases involving China related to either the actual or attempted theft of U.S. technology.\n\nBut officials have also grown more wary of Beijing\u2019s military, naming China, along with Russia, as one of the two main threats to the post-World War II international order in the latest U.S National Defense Strategy.\n\n(VOA)","title":"Outgoing US Intel Chief warns China seeking global domination - Khabarhub","url":"http://english.khabarhub.com/2020/04/146456/","video":[]}
