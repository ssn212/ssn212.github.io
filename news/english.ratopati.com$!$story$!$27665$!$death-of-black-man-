Police made several arrests with some of those arrested still being processed at the scene hours later, witnesses said.\n\nVideos showed a line of protesters on one of the tracks serving the F and Q trains. At least one of them displayed a protest sign. Subway officials shut the service on the F and Q lines around 6:15 p.m. local time (2215 GMT). Service resumed around 7 p.m. (2300 GMT), but was delayed, said the transit authority.\n\nNeely reportedly had a mental breakdown on the F train on Monday. Witnesses claimed he was yelling and pacing back and forth until Penny put him in a chokehold, which was recorded on cell phone cameras and went viral.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced on Wednesday that \"senior, experienced prosecutors\" are investigating Neely's death, which the city's medical examiner determined was a homicide caused by compression of the neck. A grand jury could be convened next week to hear evidence in the case.\n\nMonday's deadly incident has sparked protests and violent clashes this week and drawn comparisons to Bernie Goetz's shooting of four black teenagers after they allegedly tried to rob him on a subway in 1984.\n\nGoetz claimed he was in self-defense. He was ultimately acquitted of attempted murder, but fined 5,000 U.S. dollars and sentenced to six months in prison for illegal possession of weapons.","title":"Protest continues over chokehold death of black man on New York subway","url":"http://english.ratopati.com/story/27665/death-of-black-man-","video":[]}
