It also has its own dedicated image processing chip called V2 that helps with enhancing and processing images and videos furthermore.\n\nPhoto: Vivo\n\nOn the back, X Fold2 features a triple-camera setup, consisting of a 50MP bionic spectrum outsole main camera, a 12MP ultra-wide-angle camera, and a 12MP professional portrait lens. The main camera has an aperture of f/1.75 and supports OIS anti-shake, which reduces blurring and improves image stabilisation. The ultra-wide-angle camera has an aperture of f/2.0 and the portrait lens has an aperture of f/1.98.\n\nPhoto: Vivo\n\nThe rear cameras of the X Fold2 also feature a range of shooting modes, including sports, night scene, portrait, photo, video, micro movie, 50MP, panorama, ultra-clear document, slow motion, time-lapse photography, time slow door, super moon, starry sky, Zeiss landscape and architecture, professional, gourmet, Jovi scan, dual-view video, dynamic photo, and supergroup photo.\n\nThe camera system supports CMOS sensors and video anti-shake for all rear lenses.

Maybe it can. If you take the global market sales, you might not get a positive result but, the main market is located in Vivo\u2019s home ground, China itself.\n\nIf you get it in Nepal too, it might do well due to its lower price range in comparison to other foldable smartphones available in the market.","title":"Vivo X Fold2 in Nepal: How will the brand\u2019s 2nd foldable smartphone fare in the market?","url":"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/vivo-x-fold2-nepal-2023.html","video":[]}
